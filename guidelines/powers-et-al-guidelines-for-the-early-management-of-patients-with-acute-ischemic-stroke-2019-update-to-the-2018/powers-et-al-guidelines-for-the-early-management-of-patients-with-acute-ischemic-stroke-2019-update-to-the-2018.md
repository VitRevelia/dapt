*Background and Purpose*—The purpose of these guidelines is to provide an up-to-date comprehensive set of recommendations in a single document for clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke. The intended audiences are prehospital care providers, physicians, allied health professionals, and hospital administrators. These guidelines supersede the 2013 Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) Guidelines and are an update of the 2018 AIS Guidelines.

*Methods*—Members of the writing group were appointed by the American Heart Association (AHA) Stroke Council's Scientific Statements Oversight Committee, representing various areas of medical expertise. Members were not allowed to participate in discussions or to vote on topics relevant to their relations with industry. An update of the 2013 AIS Guidelines was originally published in January 2018. This guideline was approved by the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee and the AHA Executive Committee. In April 2018, a revision to these guidelines, deleting some recommendations, was published online by the AHA. The writing group was asked review the original document and revise if appropriate. In June 2018, the writing group submitted a document with minor changes and with inclusion of important newly published randomized controlled trials with >100 participants and clinical outcomes at least 90 days after AIS. The document was sent to 14 peer reviewers. The writing group evaluated the peer reviewers' comments and revised

when appropriate. The current final document was approved by all members of the writing group except when relationships with industry precluded members from voting and by the governing bodies of the AHA. These guidelines use the American College of Cardiology/AHA 2015 Class of Recommendations and Level of Evidence and the new AHA guidelines format.

- *Results*—These guidelines detail prehospital care, urgent and emergency evaluation and treatment with intravenous and intra-arterial therapies, and in-hospital management, including secondary prevention measures that are appropriately instituted within the first 2 weeks. The guidelines support the overarching concept of stroke systems of care in both the prehospital and hospital settings.
- *Conclusions*—These guidelines provide general recommendations based on the currently available evidence to guide clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke. In many instances, however, only limited data exist demonstrating the urgent need for continued research on treatment of acute ischemic stroke. **(***Stroke***. 2019;50:e344–e418.

New high-quality evidence has produced major changes in the evidence-based treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) since the publication of the guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke in 2013.1 Much of this new evidence has been incorporated into American Heart Association (AHA) focused updates, guidelines, or scientific statements on specific topics relating to the management of patients with AIS since 2013. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide an upto-date comprehensive set of recommendations for clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke in a single document. These guidelines address prehospital care, urgent and emergency evaluation and treatment with intravenous (IV) and intra-arterial therapies, and in-hospital management, including secondary prevention measures that are often begun during the initial hospitalization. We have restricted our recommendations to adults and to secondary prevention measures that are appropriately instituted within the first 2 weeks. We have not included recommendations for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis because these were covered in a 2011 scientific statement and there is no new evidence that would change those conclusions.2

An independent Evidence Review Committee was commissioned to perform a systematic review of a limited number of clinical questions identified in conjunction with the writing group, the results of which were considered by the writing group for incorporation into the "2018 Guidelines for the Early Management of Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke" (2018 AIS Guidelines)2a and this 2019 update. The systematic reviews for the 2018 AIS Guidelines have been previously published.3,4

These guidelines use the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/AHA Class of Recommendations (COR) and Level of Evidence (LOE) format shown in Table 1. New or revised recommendations that supersede previous guideline recommendations are accompanied by 250-word knowledge bytes and data supplement tables summarizing the key studies supporting the recommendations in place of extensive text. These data supplement tables can be found in [Data Supplement 1](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/suppl/10.1161/STR.0000000000000211) and literature search information for all data supplement tables can be found in [Data](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/suppl/10.1161/STR.0000000000000211)  [Supplement 2](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/suppl/10.1161/STR.0000000000000211). Because this guideline represents an update of the 2018 AIS Guidelines, the term "New Recommendation" refers to recommendations that are new to either the 2018 AIS Guidelines or to this 2019 update. Existing recommendations that are unchanged are reiterated with reference to the previous publication. These previous publications and their abbreviations used in this document are listed in Table 2. When there is no new pertinent evidence for these unchanged recommendations, no knowledge byte or data supplement is provided. For some unchanged recommendations, there are new pertinent data that support the existing recommendation, and these are provided. Additional abbreviations used in this guideline are listed in Table 3.

Members of the writing committee were appointed by the AHA Stroke Council's Scientific Statements Oversight Committee, representing various areas of medical expertise. Strict adherence to the AHA conflict-of-interest policy was maintained throughout the writing and consensus process. Members were not allowed to participate in discussions or to vote on topics relevant to their relations with industry. Writing group members accepted topics relevant to their areas of expertise, reviewed the stroke literature with emphasis on publications since the prior guidelines, and drafted recommendations. Draft recommendations and supporting evidence were discussed by the writing group, and the revised recommendations for each topic were reviewed by a designated writing group member. The full writing group then evaluated the complete guidelines. The members of the writing group unanimously approved all recommendations except when relations with industry precluded members voting. Prerelease review of the draft 2018 guidelines was performed by 4 expert peer reviewers and by the members of the Stroke Council's Scientific Statements Oversight Committee and Stroke Council Leadership Committee. The 2018 AIS Guidelines were approved by the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee on November 29, 2017, and by the AHA Executive Committee on December 11, 2017. It was published online January 24, 2018. On April 18, 2018, the AHA published a revision to the AIS Guidelines online, deleting 7 specific recommendations and all of Section 6, In-Hospital Institution of Secondary Prevention. The writing group was asked to review the entire guideline, including the deleted recommendations. In June 2018, the writing group submitted a document with minor changes and with inclusion of important newly published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with >100 participants and clinical outcomes at least 90 days after AIS. The document was sent out to 14 peer reviewers. The writing group evaluated the peer reviewers' comments and revised when appropriate. This revised document was reviewed by Stroke Council's Scientific Statements Oversight Committee and the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee. To allow these guidelines to be as timely as possible, RCTs addressing AIS published between November 2018 and April 2019 were reviewed by the writing group. Modifications of Section 3.5.6., Recommendation 1, Section 3.6., Recommendation 4, and **Table 1. Applying ACC/AHA Class of Recommendation and Level of Evidence to Clinical Strategies, Interventions, Treatments, or Diagnostic Testing in Patient Care\* (Updated August 2015)**

Section 3.7.2., Recommendation 2 resulted. To allow these modifications to be incorporated, the standard peer review process was abbreviated, with review provided by the members of the Stroke Council's Scientific Statements Oversight Committee and by liaisons from the endorsing organizations listed on the masthead. The list of these reviewers is provided at the end of the guideline. The final document was approved by the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee and Executive Committee.

These guidelines provide general recommendations based on the currently available evidence to guide clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke. They will not be applicable to all patients. Local resources and expertise, specific clinical circumstances and patient preferences, and evidence published since the issuance of these guidelines are some of the additional factors that should be considered when making individual patient care decisions. In many instances, only limited data exist demonstrating the urgent need for continued research on treatment of AIS.

A focused update addressing data from additional relevant recent RCTs is in process.

| 1. Public health leaders, along with medical professionals and others, should<br>design and implement public education programs focused on stroke systems<br>and the need to seek emergency care (by calling 9-1-1) in a rapid manner.<br>These programs should be sustained over time and designed to reach racially/<br>ethnically, age, and sex diverse populations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | I                                                   | B-NR | Recommendation revised from 2013<br>Stroke Systems of Care.

| 2. Such educational programs should be designed to specifically target the<br>public, physicians, hospital personnel, and emergency medical services (EMS)<br>personnel to increase use of the 9-1-1 EMS system, to decrease stroke onset<br>to emergency department (ED) arrival times, and to increase timely use of<br>thrombolysis and thrombectomy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | I                                                   | C-EO | New recommendation.                                                                                                                                |
| Early stroke symptom recognition is essential for seeking timely care. Unfortunately, knowledge of stroke warning<br>signs and risk factors in the United States remains poor. Blacks and Hispanics particularly have lower stroke<br>awareness than the general population and are at increased risk of prehospital delays in seeking care.20 These factors<br>may contribute to the disparities in stroke outcomes. Available evidence suggests that public awareness interventions<br>are variably effective by age, sex, and racial/ethnic minority status.21 Thus, stroke education campaigns should be<br>designed in a targeted manner to optimize their effectiveness.21                                                                                                                                                                  | See Tables I and II in online Data<br>Supplement 1. |      |                                                                                                                                                    |
| 3. Activation of the 9-1-1 system by patients or other members of the public<br>is strongly recommended. 9-1-1 dispatchers should make stroke a priority<br>dispatch, and transport times should be minimized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | I                                                   | B-NR | Recommendation and COR unchanged<br>from 2013 AIS Guidelines.

| EMS use by stroke patients has been independently associated with earlier ED arrival (onset-to-door time ≤3 hours;<br>adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.00 [95% CI, 1.93–2.08]), quicker ED evaluation (more patients with door-to-imaging<br>time ≤25 minutes; OR, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.78–2.00]), more rapid treatment (more patients with door-to-needle [DTN]<br>time ≤60 minutes; OR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.28–1.63]), and more eligible patients being treated with alteplase if onset is<br>≤2 hours (67% versus 44%; OR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.33–1.64]),21 yet only ≈60% of all stroke patients use EMS.22 Men,<br>blacks, and Hispanics are less likely to use EMS.20,22 Thus, persistent efforts to ensure activation of the 9-1-1 or similar<br>emergency system by patients or other members of the public in the case of a suspected stroke are warranted. | See Table I in online Data Supplement 1.            |      |                                                                                                                                                    |

| Multiple stroke screening tools have been developed for prehospital evaluation of suspected stroke. A 2016<br>systematic review assessed the performance of 7 tools.26 Those with the highest number of subjects in whom the<br>tool had been applied included Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS),27 Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen<br>(LAPSS),28 Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER),29 and FAST (Face, Arm, Speech, Time).30 CPSS and<br>FAST performed similarly with regard to sensitivity (range, 44%–95% for CPSS, 79%–97% for FAST) but both had<br>poor specificity (range, 24%–79% for CPSS, 13%–88% for FAST). More complex tools such as LAPSS had improved<br>specificity (range, 48%–97%) but at the cost of sensitivity (range, 59%–91%). All tools inadequately accounted<br>for false-negative cases, thereby likely artificially boosting performance. The review concluded that no strong<br>recommendation could be made for use of one tool over another.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |     |      | See Tables III and IV in online Data<br>Supplement 1.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Effective prehospital procedures to identify patients who are ineligible for IV<br>thrombolysis and have a strong probability of large vessel occlusion (LVO)<br>stroke should be developed to facilitate rapid transport of patients potentially<br>eligible for thrombectomy to the closest healthcare facilities that are able to<br>perform mechanical thrombectomy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | IIb | C-EO | New recommendation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| At least 6 stroke severity scales targeted at recognition of LVO in the prehospital setting to facilitate transfer to<br>endovascular centers have been published.31–36 The 2018 AHA systematic review on the accuracy of prediction<br>instruments for diagnosing LVO in patients with suspected stroke concluded that "No scale predicted LVO with both<br>high sensitivity and high specificity."4<br>Specifically, the probability of LVO with a positive LVO prediction test was<br>thought to be only 50% to 60%, whereas >10% of those with a negative test may have an LVO. Thus, more effective<br>tools are needed to identify suspected stroke patients with a strong probability of LVO.<br>All the scales were initially derived from data sets of confirmed stroke cases or selected prehospital cases, and<br>there has been only limited study of their performance in the prehospital setting.37–39 For prehospital patients with<br>suspected LVO by a stroke severity scale, the Mission: Lifeline Severity–based Stroke Triage Algorithm for EMS40<br>recommends direct transport to a comprehensive stroke center if the travel time to the comprehensive stroke center<br>is <15 additional minutes compared with the travel time to the closest primary stroke center or acute stroke-ready<br>hospital. However, at this time, there is insufficient evidence to recommend 1 scale over the other or a specific<br>threshold of additional travel time for which bypass of a primary stroke center or acute stroke-ready hospital is<br>justifiable. Given the known impact of delays to IV alteplase on outcomes,41 the known impact of delays to mechanical<br>thrombectomy on outcome,42 and the anticipated delays in transport for mechanical thrombectomy in eligible patients<br>originally triaged to a nonendovascular center, the Mission: Lifeline algorithm may be a reasonable guideline in some<br>circumstances. Customization of the guideline to optimize patient outcomes will be needed to account for local and<br>regional factors, including the availability of endovascular centers, door in–door out times for nonendovascular stroke<br>centers, interhospital transport times, and DTN and door-to-puncture times. Rapid, protected, collaborative, regional<br>quality review, including EMS agencies and hospitals, is recommended for operationalized bypass algorithms. Further<br>research is needed. |     |      | See Table III in online Data Supplement<br>1.                                                                                                                                                                                                |

State primary stroke centers had higher in-hospital risk-adjusted mortality (OR, 1.23<br>[95% CI, 1.07–1.41]) compared with TJC-certified primary stroke centers.44 |     |      | See Table V in online Data Supplement<br>1.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Multicomponent quality improvement initiatives, which include ED education<br>and multidisciplinary teams with access to neurological expertise, are<br>recommended to safely increase IV fibrinolytic treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | I   | A    | New recommendation.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Multicomponent quality improvement programs to improve stroke care demonstrate clear utility in safely increasing<br>alteplase use in the community hospital setting in multiple settings. The US cluster-randomized INSTINCT trial<br>(Increasing Stroke Treatment Through Interventional Change Tactics) demonstrated increased rates of alteplase<br>use among all stroke patients. In the intervention group hospitals, alteplase use increased from 59 of 5882 (1.00%)<br>before intervention to 191 of 7288 (2.62%) after intervention. This compared favorably with the change in the<br>control group hospitals from 65 of 5957 (1.09%) to 120 of 6989 (1.72%), with a relative risk (RR) of 1.68 (95%<br>CI, 1.09–2.57; P=0.02). Safety was also demonstrated with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (within 36<br>hours) in 24 of 404 (5.9%) treated strokes.45 In the PRACTISE trial (Penumbra and Recanalisation Acute Computed<br>Tomography in Ischaemic Stroke Evaluation), a multilevel intervention was conducted in a sample of 12 Dutch<br>hospitals. After implementation of an intensive stroke treatment strategy, intervention hospitals treated 393 patients<br>with IV alteplase (13.1% of all patients with acute stroke) versus 308 (12.2%) at control hospitals (adjusted OR, 1.25<br>[95% CI, 0.93–1.68]).46 The AVC (Impact of a Training Program and Organization on the Management of Stroke in<br>the Acute Phase) II trial identified a similar magnitude of improvement (adjusted OR, 1.39 [95% CI, 1.01–2.02]) for<br>overall fibrinolytic delivery between intervention and control groups) among 18 emergency units in France using a<br>train-the-trainer approach.47 |     |      | See Tables VI and VII in online Data<br>Supplement 1.                                                                                                                                            |

| Treatment of AIS with IV tissue-type plasminogen activator is of proven benefit for select patients given up to 4.5<br>hours after symptom onset.48,49 Pooled data from RCTs indicate the benefit is greatest when treatment occurs early<br>after stroke onset and declines with time.50 Registry data from AHA GWTG-Stroke hospitals confirm this temporal<br>relationship. In an analysis of 58 353 alteplase-treated patients, treatment started more rapidly (evaluated in<br>15-minute increments) was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality (OR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.95–0.98]; P<0.001),<br>reduced symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) (OR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.95–0.98]; P<0.001), increased<br>independent ambulation at discharge (OR, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.03–1.05]; P<0.001), and increased discharge to home (OR,<br>1.03 [95% CI, 1.02–1.04]; P<0.001). Patient factors most strongly associated with shorter onset-to-treatment times<br>include greater stroke severity, arrival by ambulance, and arrival during regular hours.41 With respect to endovascular<br>treatment, a pooled analysis of 5 randomized trials comparing endovascular therapy (EVT) with medical therapy alone<br>in which the majority of the patients were treated within 6 hours found that the odds of improved disability outcomes<br>at 90 days (as measured by the modified Rankin Scale [mRS] distribution) declined with longer time from symptom<br>onset to arterial puncture.42 The 6- to 16- and 6- to 24-hour treatment windows trials, which used advanced imaging<br>to identify a relatively uniform patient group, showed limited variability of treatment effect with time in these highly<br>selected patients.51,52 The absence of detailed screening logs in these trials limits estimations of the true impact<br>of time in this population.

| In AHA GWTG-Stroke hospitals, median DTN time for IV alteplase administration decreased from 77 minutes<br>(interquartile range, 60–98 minutes) during the 2003 to 2009 preintervention period to 67 minutes (interquartile range,<br>51–87 minutes) during the 2010 to 2013 postintervention period (P<0.001).

| 1. For sites without in-house imaging interpretation expertise, teleradiology<br>systems approved by the US Food and Drug Administration are recommended<br>for timely review of brain imaging in patients with suspected acute stroke.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | I   | A    | Recommendation revised from 2013 AIS<br>Guidelines.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2. When implemented within a telestroke network, teleradiology systems<br>approved by the US Food and Drug Administration are effective in supporting<br>rapid imaging interpretation in time for IV alteplase administration decision<br>making.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | I   | A    | Recommendation reworded for clarity<br>from 2013 AIS Guidelines. COR<br>unchanged. LOE revised.<br>See Table XCV in online Data<br>Supplement 1 for original wording.                                                                        |
| Studies of teleradiology to read brain imaging in acute stroke have successfully assessed feasibility; agreement<br>between telestroke neurologists, radiologists, and neuroradiologists over the presence or absence of radiological<br>contraindications to IV alteplase; and reliability of telestroke radiological evaluations. Further support for this<br>unchanged recommendation from the 2013 AIS Guidelines with LOE upgraded to A is provided by 3 additional studies<br>published since the 2013 Guidelines.55–57 |     |      | See Table X in online Data Supplement<br>1.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 3. The use of telemedicine/telestroke resources and systems should be<br>supported by healthcare institutions, governments, payers, and vendors<br>as one method to ensure adequate 24/7 coverage and care of acute stroke<br>patients in a variety of settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | I   | C-EO | Recommendation reworded for clarity<br>from 2013 Stroke Systems of Care.<br>COR and LOE added to conform with<br>ACC/AHA 2015 Recommendation<br>Classification System.<br>See Table XCV in online Data<br>Supplement 1 for original wording. |
| 4. Telestroke/teleradiology evaluations of AIS patients can be effective for<br>correct IV alteplase eligibility decision making.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | IIa | B-R  | New recommendation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| The STRokEDOC (Stroke Team Remote Evaluation Using a Digital Observation Camera) pooled analysis supported the<br>hypothesis that telemedicine consultations, which included teleradiology, compared with telephone-only resulted in<br>statistically significantly more accurate IV alteplase eligibility decision-making for patients exhibiting symptoms and<br>signs of an acute stroke syndrome in EDs.58                                                                                                                |     |      | See Table XI in online Data Supplement<br>1.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Administration of IV alteplase guided by telestroke consultation for patients<br>with AIS can be beneficial.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | IIa | B-NR                                           | New recommendation.                           |
| A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IV alteplase delivered<br>through telestroke networks in patients with AIS. sICH rates were similar between patients subjected to telemedicine<br>guided IV alteplase and those receiving IV alteplase at stroke centers. There was no difference in mortality or in<br>functional independence at 3 months between telestroke-guided and stroke center–managed patients. The findings<br>indicate that IV alteplase delivery through telestroke networks is safe and effective in the 3-hour time window.59                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |     |                                                | See Table XII in online Data Supplement<br>1. |

Telestroke networks may be reasonable for triaging patients with AIS<br>who may be eligible for interfacility transfer in order to be considered for<br>emergency mechanical thrombectomy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | IIb | B-NR                                           | New recommendation.                           |
| An observational study compared clinical outcomes of EVT between patients with anterior circulation stroke transferred after<br>teleconsultation and those directly admitted to a tertiary stroke center. The study evaluated 151 patients who underwent<br>emergency EVT for anterior circulation stroke. Of these, 48 patients (31.8%) were transferred after teleconsultation, and<br>103 (68.2%) were admitted primarily through an ED. Transferred patients were younger, received IV alteplase more<br>frequently, had prolonged time from stroke onset to EVT initiation, and tended to have lower rates of symptomatic intracranial<br>hemorrhage and mortality than directly admitted patients. Similar rates of reperfusion and favorable functional outcomes<br>were observed in patients treated by telestroke and those who were directly admitted.

| 2. Different services within a hospital that may be transferring patients through<br>a continuum of care, as well as different hospitals that may be transferring<br>patients to other facilities, should establish hand-off and transfer protocols<br>and procedures that ensure safe and efficient patient care within and<br>between facilities.

It may be useful for government agencies and third-party payers to develop<br>and implement reimbursement schedules for patients with acute stroke that<br>reflect the demanding care and expertise that such patients require to achieve<br>an optimal outcome, regardless of whether they receive a specific medication<br>or procedure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | IIb | C-EO | Recommendation revised from 2013<br>Stroke Systems of Care. |
| Multiple studies evaluating fibrinolytic therapy and mechanical thrombectomy, alone or in combination, have<br>demonstrated substantial societal economic value for acute stroke treatment across multiple countries. Pre–<br>mechanical thrombectomy era data demonstrate that, in the United States, cost savings of approximately US \$30<br>million would be realized if the proportion of all ischemic stroke patients receiving IV alteplase was increased to 8%.<br>This excludes any gain from increased quality-adjusted life-years gained, a source of tremendous additional economic<br>and patient value. Before the implementation of Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Diagnosis-Related Group<br>559 payment in 2005, treatment of acute stroke was economically discouraged at a hospital level because of a high<br>hospital cost-reimbursement ratio. Diagnosis-Related Group 559 favorably altered the cost-reimbursement ratio for<br>stroke care. In a single-hospital study, this ratio decreased from 1.41 (95% CI, 0.98–2.28) before Diagnosis-Related<br>Group 559 to 0.82 (95% CI, 0.66–0.97) after Diagnosis-Related Group 559. The subsequent years corresponded<br>to a period of rapid growth in the number of primary stroke centers and increasing total stroke treatment cases.<br>Addressing economic barriers to treatment is important as acute stroke care complexity evolves.63–68 |     |      |                                                             |

| The benefit of IV alteplase is time dependent, with earlier treatment within the therapeutic window leading to bigger<br>proportional benefits.42,78 A brain imaging study to exclude ICH is recommended as part of the initial evaluation of<br>patients who are potentially eligible for these therapies. With respect to endovascular treatment, a pooled analysis<br>of 5 randomized trials comparing EVT with medical therapy alone in which the majority of the patients were treated<br>within 6 hours found that the odds of improved disability outcomes at 90 days (as measured by the mRS score<br>distribution) declined with longer time from symptom onset to arterial puncture.42 The 6- to 16- and 6- to 24-hour<br>treatment windows trials, which used advanced imaging to identify a relatively uniform patient group, showed limited<br>variability of treatment effect with time in these highly selected patients.51,52 The absence of detailed screening logs<br>in these trials limits estimations of the true impact of time in this population. To ensure that the highest proportion of<br>eligible patients presenting in the 6- to 24-hour window have access to mechanical thrombectomy, evaluation and<br>treatment should be as rapid as possible. Reducing the time interval from ED presentation to initial brain imaging can<br>help to reduce the time to treatment initiation. Studies have shown that median or mean door-to-imaging times of ≤20<br>minutes can be achieved in a variety of different hospital settings.79–81                                      |     |      | See Tables XVI and XVII in online Data<br>Supplement 1.                                                                                                          |

| CMBs are common in patients receiving IV alteplase, occurring in 15% to 27%.89–94 Such patients were undoubtedly<br>included in the pivotal NINDS and ECASS III trials that established the benefits of IV alteplase treatment.48,49 Two meta<br>analyses of the association of baseline CMBs and the risk of sICH after IV alteplase reported that sICH is more common<br>in patients with baseline CMBs, whereas 2 other meta-analyses and 1 multicenter study did not.89–93 In 2 studies using<br>ECASS II sICH criteria, the rates in patients with CMBs were 5.8% and 6.5% compared with 5.3% in ECASS III.49,90,91<br>One study analyzing the risk of sICH in patients with CMBs detected after IV alteplase treatment reported sICH of 5%<br>using the NINDS criteria compared with 6.4% in the NINDS tPA trials.48,94 The risk of sICH in patients with >10 CMBs<br>(30%–47%) is consistently reported as significantly greater than in those with no CMBs (1%–4.4%). However, these<br>data are based on <50 patients, constituting <2% of these series.90,91,93,94 No RCTs of IV alteplase in AIS with baseline<br>MRI to identify CMBs have been conducted, so no determination of the effect of baseline CMB on the treatment effect<br>of alteplase with CMB is available. In the absence of direct evidence that IV alteplase provides no benefit or produces<br>harm in eligible patients with CMBs, withholding treatment on the basis of the presence of CMBs could lead to the<br>exclusion of patients who would benefit from treatment. |     |      | See Table XXI in online Data Supplement<br>1. |

| 2. For patients with suspected LVO who have not had noninvasive vessel<br>imaging as part of their initial imaging assessment for stroke, noninvasive<br>vessel imaging should then be obtained as quickly as possible (eg, during<br>alteplase infusion if feasible).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | I                                                        | A    | Recommendation revised from 2015<br>Endovascular.

| A recent systematic review evaluated the accuracy of prediction instruments for diagnosing LVO.4<br>confirmed ischemic stroke patients would be assessed by a neurologist or emergency physician in the ED, the authors<br>suggested that the NIHSS score is the best of the LVO prediction instruments. According to their meta-analysis, a<br>threshold of ≥10 would provide the optimal balance between sensitivity (73%) and specificity (74%). To maximize<br>sensitivity (at the cost of lower specificity), a threshold of ≥6 would have 87% sensitivity and 52% specificity.<br>However, even this low threshold misses some cases with LVO, whereas the low specificity indicates that false<br>positives will be common. The sensitivity of CTA and MRA compared with the gold standard of catheter angiography<br>ranges from 87% to 100%, with CTA having greater accuracy than MRA.95,96 Pivotal trials of mechanical thrombectomy<br>all required noninvasive CTA or MRA diagnosis of LVO as an inclusion criterion. | See Tables XVII and XXII in online Data<br>Supplement 1. |      |                                                                                                                                                                |

In patients with suspected intracranial LVO and no history of renal<br>impairment, who otherwise meet criteria for mechanical thrombectomy,<br>it is reasonable to proceed with CTA if indicated before obtaining a serum<br>creatinine concentration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | IIa                                                      | B-NR | New recommendation.                                                                                                                                            |
| Analyses from a number of observational studies suggest that the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy secondary to<br>CTA imaging is relatively low, particularly in patients without a history of renal impairment.

| 1. When selecting patients with AIS within 6 to 24 hours of last known normal<br>who have LVO in the anterior circulation, obtaining CTP or DW-MRI, with<br>or without MRI perfusion, is recommended to aid in patient selection for<br>mechanical thrombectomy, but only when patients meet other eligibility<br>criteria from one of the RCTs that showed benefit from mechanical<br>thrombectomy in this extended time window.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | I   | A    | New recommendation.                            |
| The DAWN trial (Clinical Mismatch in the Triage of Wake Up and Late Presenting Strokes Undergoing Neurointervention<br>With Trevo) used clinical-core mismatch (a combination of age-adjusted NIHSS score and age-adjusted core infarct<br>size on CTP or DW-MRI) as an eligibility criterion to select patients with large anterior circulation vessel occlusion for<br>mechanical thrombectomy between 6 and 24 hours from last known normal. This trial demonstrated an overall benefit<br>in functional outcome at 90 days in the treatment group (mRS score 0–2, 49% versus 13%; adjusted difference, 33%<br>[95% CI, 21–44]; posterior probability of superiority >0.999).51 The DEFUSE 3 trial (Diffusion and Perfusion Imaging<br>Evaluation for Understanding Stroke Evolution) used perfusion-core mismatch and maximum core size as imaging<br>criteria to select patients with large anterior circulation occlusion 6 to 16 hours from last seen well for mechanical<br>thrombectomy. This trial showed a benefit in functional outcome at 90 days in the treated group (mRS score 0–2,<br>44.6% versus 16.7%; RR, 2.67 [95% CI, 1.60–4.48]; P<0.0001).52 Benefit was independently demonstrated for the<br>subgroup of patients who met DAWN eligibility criteria and for the subgroup who did not. DAWN and DEFUSE 3 are the<br>only RCTs showing benefit of mechanical thrombectomy >6 hours from onset. Therefore, only the eligibility criteria<br>from one or the other of these trials should be used for patient selection. Although future RCTs may demonstrate that<br>additional eligibility criteria can be used to select patients who benefit from mechanical thrombectomy, at this time,<br>the DAWN or DEFUSE 3 eligibility should be strictly adhered to in clinical practice.51,52 |     |      | See Table XVII in online Data<br>Supplement 1. |

When evaluating patients with AIS within 6 hours of last known normal<br>with LVO and an Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score<br>(ASPECTS) of ≥6, selection for mechanical thrombectomy based on CT and<br>CTA or MRI and MRA is recommended in preference to performance of<br>additional imaging such as perfusion studies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | I   | B-NR | New recommendation.                            |
| Of the 6 RCTs that independently demonstrated clinical benefit of mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers<br>when performed <6 hours from stroke onset, 4 trials (REVASCAT [Randomized Trial of Revascularization With<br>Solitaire FR Device Versus Best Medical Therapy in the Treatment of Acute Stroke Due to Anterior Circulation Large<br>Vessel Occlusion Presenting Within Eight Hours of Symptom Onset], SWIFT PRIME [Solitaire With the Intention<br>for Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular Treatment], EXTEND-IA [Extending the Time for Thrombolysis in<br>Emergency Neurological Deficits–Intra-Arterial], and ESCAPE)105–108 used some form of advanced imaging to<br>determine eligibility, whereas 2 (THRACE [Trial and Cost Effectiveness Evaluation of Intra-Arterial Thrombectomy<br>in Acute Ischemic Stroke] and MR CLEAN)109,110 required only NCCT and demonstration of LVO. Because the last 2<br>studies independently demonstrated benefit in the treated group, the role of additional imaging-based eligibility<br>criteria is not well established and could lead to the exclusion of patients who would benefit from treatment and<br>are therefore not indicated at this time. Further RCTs may be helpful to determine whether advanced imaging<br>paradigms using CTP, CTA, and MRI perfusion and diffusion imaging, including measures of infarct core and<br>penumbra, are beneficial for selecting patients for reperfusion therapy who are within 6 hours of symptom onset<br>and have an ASPECTS <6.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |     |      | See Table XVII in online Data<br>Supplement 1. |

| Recommendation was modified to clarify that it is only blood glucose that must be measured in all patients. Other<br>tests, for example, international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, and platelet count, may be<br>necessary in some circumstances if there is suspicion of coagulopathy. Given the extremely low risk of unsuspected<br>abnormal platelet counts or coagulation studies in a population, IV alteplase treatment should not be delayed while<br>waiting for hematologic or coagulation testing if there is no reason to suspect an abnormal test. |     |      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 4. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is not recommended for patients with AIS except<br>when caused by air embolization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | III: No<br>Benefit | B-NR | Recommendation revised from 2013 AIS<br>Guidelines. |
| The limited data available on the utility of HBO therapy for AIS (not related to cerebral air embolism) show no<br>benefit.113 HBO therapy is associated with claustrophobia and middle ear barotrauma,114 as well as an increased<br>risk of seizures.115 Given the confines of HBO chambers, the ability to closely/adequately monitor patients may also<br>be compromised. HBO thus should be offered only in the context of a clinical trial or to individuals with cerebral air<br>embolism. |                    |      | See Table XXVIII in online Data<br>Supplement 1.    |

| The RCTs of IV alteplase required the BP to be <185 mmHg systolic and <110 mmHg diastolic before treatment and<br><180/105 mmHg for the first 24 hours after treatment. Options to treat arterial hypertension in patients with AIS who<br>are candidates for immediate reperfusion therapy are given in Table 5. Some observational studies suggest that the<br>risk of hemorrhage after administration of alteplase is greater in patients with higher BPs125–131 and in patients with<br>more BP variability.132 The exact BP at which the risk of hemorrhage after IV alteplase increases is unknown. It is thus<br>reasonable to target the BPs used in the RCTs of IV alteplase.                |     |      | See Tables XX and XXX in online Data<br>Supplement 1.                                                                                                                   |
| 3. In patients for whom mechanical thrombectomy is planned and who have<br>not received IV fibrinolytic therapy, it is reasonable to maintain BP ≤185/110<br>mmHg before the procedure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | IIa | B-NR | Recommendation revised from 2013 AIS<br>Guidelines.                                                                                                                     |
| Of the 6 RCTs that each independently demonstrated clinical benefit of mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers<br>when performed <6 hours from stroke onset, 5 (REVASCAT, SWIFT PRIME, EXTEND-IA, THRACE, and MR CLEAN)106–110<br>had eligibility exclusions for BP >185/110 mmHg. The sixth, ESCAPE,105 had no BP eligibility exclusion. DAWN also<br>used an exclusion for BP >185/110 mmHg.51 RCT data for optimal BP management approaches in this setting are not<br>available. Because the vast majority of patients enrolled in these RCTs had preprocedural BP managed below 185/110<br>mmHg, it is reasonable to use this level as a guideline until additional data become available. |     |      | See Table XVII in online Data<br>Supplement 1.                                                                                                                          |

| The safety and efficacy of this treatment when administered within the first 3 hours after stroke onset are solidly<br>supported by combined data from multiple RCTs155–157 and confirmed by extensive community experience in many<br>countries.158 The eligibility criteria for IV alteplase have evolved over time as its usefulness and true risks have<br>become clearer. A recent AHA statement provides a detailed discussion of this topic.14 Eligibility recommendations<br>for IV alteplase in patients with AIS are summarized in Table 8. The benefit of IV alteplase is well established for adult<br>patients with disabling stroke symptoms regardless of age and stroke severity.78,159 Because of this proven benefit<br>and the need to expedite treatment, when a patient cannot provide consent (eg, aphasia, confusion) and a legally<br>authorized representative is not immediately available to provide proxy consent, it is justified to proceed with IV<br>alteplase in an otherwise eligible adult patient with a disabling AIS. In a recent trial, a lower dose of IV alteplase (0.6<br>mg/kg) was not shown to be noninferior to standard-dose IV alteplase for the reduction of death and disability at 90<br>days.160 |     |     | See Table XX in online Data Supplement<br>1.                                                                                                                     |

| One trial (ECASS III) specifically evaluating the efficacy of IV alteplase within 3 and 4.5 hours after symptom onset49<br>and pooled analysis of multiple trials testing IV alteplase within various time windows155–157 support the efficacy of IV<br>alteplase up to 4.5 hours after symptom onset. ECASS III excluded octogenarians, patients taking warfarin regardless<br>of international normalized ratio, patients with combined history of diabetes mellitus and previous ischemic stroke, and<br>patients with very severe strokes (NIHSS score >25) because of a perceived excessive risk of intracranial hemorrhage in<br>those cases. However, careful analysis of available published data summarized in an AHA/American Stroke Association<br>(ASA) scientific statement indicates that these exclusion criteria from the trial may not be justified in practice (Table 8).14                                                            |     |     | See Table XX in online Data Supplement<br>1.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| The WAKE-UP RCT randomized 503 patients with AIS who awoke with stroke or had unclear time of onset and could<br>be treated with IV alteplase within 4.5 hours of stroke symptom recognition. Eligibility required MRI mismatch between<br>abnormal signal on DW-MRI and no visible signal change on FLAIR. DW-MRI lesions larger than one-third of the<br>territory of the MCA, NIHSS score >25, contraindication to treatment with alteplase, or planned thrombectomy were all<br>exclusions. Ninety-four percent were wake-up strokes. Median NIHSS score was 6. Median time from last known well<br>to symptom recognition was ≈7 hours and to alteplase administration slightly over 10 hours. The primary end point<br>of an mRS score 0 to 1 at 90 days was achieved in 53.3% of the alteplase group and in 41.8% of the placebo group<br>(P=0.02). Only 20% had LVO of the intracranial internal carotid or proximal middle cerebral arteries.88 |     |     | See Table XIX in online Data Supplement<br>1.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| CMBs are common in patients receiving IV alteplase, occurring in 15% to 27%.89–94 No RCTs of IV alteplase in AIS with<br>baseline MRI to identify CMBs have been conducted, so no determination of the effect of baseline CMB on the treatment<br>effect of alteplase with CMB is available. Two meta-analyses of the association of baseline CMBs on the risk of sICH after<br>IV alteplase reported that sICH is more common in patients with baseline CMBs, whereas 2 other meta-analyses and 1<br>multicenter study did not.89–93 In 2 studies using ECASS II sICH criteria, the rates in patients with CMBs were 5.8% and<br>6.5% compared with 5.3% in ECASS III.49,90,91 One study analyzing the risk of sICH in patients with CMBs detected after IV<br>alteplase treatment reported sICH of 5% using the NINDS criteria compared with 6.4% in the NINDS rt-PA trials.48,94 The risk<br>of sICH in patients with >10 CMBs (30%–47%) is consistently reported as significantly greater than in those with no CMBs<br>(1%–4.4%). However, these data are based on <50 patients, constituting < 2% of these series.90,91,93,94 Meta-analysis of 4<br>studies that provide information on 3- to 6-month functional outcomes showed that the presence of CMBs was associated<br>with worse outcomes after IV alteplase compared with patients without CMBs (OR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.18–2.14]; P=0.002).89<br>Thus, the presence of CMBs increases the risk of ICH and the chances of poor outcomes after IV alteplase, but it is unclear<br>whether these negative effects fully negate the benefit of IV alteplase. It is also unknown whether the location and number<br>of CMBs may differentially influence outcomes. These questions deserve further investigation. |           |      | See Table XXI in online Data Supplement<br>1.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Administration of IV alteplase in this patient population may be reasonable.† (COR IIb; LOE C-LD§<br>(Note: Alteplase administration within 21 d of a GI bleeding event is not recommended; see Contraindications.)                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Menstruation                           | IV alteplase is probably indicated in women who are menstruating who present with AIS and do not have a history of<br>menorrhagia.

|                                        | Because of the increased risk of ICH in this population of patients, IV alteplase may be considered in patients with stroke<br>with severe neurological deficits and a high likelihood of morbidity and mortality to outweigh the anticipated risk of ICH.†<br>(COR IIb; LOE C-LD)§                                                            |

Primary end point was<br>reperfusion of >50% of the involved ischemic territory or an absence of retrievable thrombus at the time of the<br>initial angiographic assessment. The trial was designed to test for noninferiority and, if noninferiority proven, for<br>superiority. Secondary outcomes included the mRS score at 90 days. Median NIHSS score was 17. The primary end<br>point was achieved by 22% of patients treated with tenecteplase versus 10% of those treated with alteplase (P=0.002<br>for noninferiority and 0.03 for superiority). In an analysis of secondary end points, tenecteplase resulted in better<br>functional outcomes at 90 days on the basis of the ordinal shift analysis of the mRS score (common OR [cOR], 1.7<br>[95% CI, 1.0–2.8]; P=0.04) but less robustly for the proportion who achieved an mRS score of 0 to 1 (P=0.23) or 0 to<br>2 (P=0.06). sICH rates were 1% in both groups. | See Table XLIII in online Data<br>Supplement 1. |     |                                                     |

| In pooled patient-level data from 5 trials (HERMES [Highly Effective Reperfusion Evaluated in Multiple Endovascular<br>Stroke Trials], which included the 5 trials MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, REVASCAT, SWIFT PRIME, and EXTEND-IA), the odds of<br>better disability outcomes at 90 days (mRS score distribution) with the mechanical thrombectomy group declined with<br>longer time from symptom onset to expected arterial puncture: cOR at 3 hours, 2.79 (95% CI, 1.96–3.98), absolute<br>risk difference (ARD) for lower disability scores, 39.2%; cOR at 6 hours, 1.98 (95% CI, 1.30–3.00), ARD, 30.2%;<br>and cOR at 8 hours, 1.57 (95% CI, 0.86–2.88), ARD, 15.7%, retaining statistical significance through 7 hours 18<br>minutes.42 Among 390 patients who achieved substantial reperfusion with endovascular thrombectomy, each 1-hour<br>delay to reperfusion was associated with a less favorable degree of disability (cOR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.76–0.93]; ARD,<br>−6.7%) and less functional independence (OR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.71–0.92]; ARD, −5.2% [95% CI, −8.3 to −2.1]) but no<br>change in mortality (OR, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.93–1.34]; ARD, 1.5% [95% CI, −0.9 to 4.2]).42 The REVASCAT trial included<br>a 30-minute period of observation before undertaking EVT. Available data do not directly address the question of<br>whether patients should be observed after IV alteplase to assess for clinical response before pursuing mechanical<br>thrombectomy. However, one can infer that because disability outcomes at 90 days were directly associated with time<br>from symptom onset to arterial puncture, any cause for delay to mechanical thrombectomy, including observing for<br>a clinical response after IV alteplase, should be avoided. Therefore, the recommendation is slightly modified from the<br>2015 Endovascular Update. |           |     | See Tables XVII and XLV in online Data<br>Supplement 1. |

| Results from 6 recent randomized trials of mechanical thrombectomy using predominantly stent retriever devices (MR<br>CLEAN, SWIFT PRIME, EXTEND-IA, ESCAPE, REVASCAT, THRACE) support COR I, LOE A recommendations for a defined<br>group of patients as described in the 2015 Guidelines.105–110 A pooled, patient-level analysis from 5 of these studies<br>reported by the HERMES Collaboration showed treatment effect in the subgroup of 188 patients not treated with IV<br>alteplase (cOR, 2.43 [95% CI, 1.30–4.55]); therefore, pretreatment with IV alteplase has been removed from the prior<br>recommendation. The HERMES pooled patient-level data also showed that mechanical thrombectomy had a favorable<br>effect over standard care in patients ≥80 years of age (cOR, 3.68 [95% CI, 1.95–6.92]).189 In patient-level data<br>pooled from trials in which the Solitaire was the only or the predominant device used, a prespecified meta-analysis<br>(SEER Collaboration [Safety and Efficacy of Solitaire Stent Thrombectomy–Individual Patient Data Meta-Analysis of<br>Randomized Trials]: SWIFT PRIME, ESCAPE, EXTEND-IA, REVASCAT) showed that mechanical thrombectomy had a<br>favorable effect over standard care in patients ≥80 years of age (3.46 [95% CI, 1.58–7.60]).190 In a meta-analysis<br>of 5 RCTs (MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, EXTEND-IA, SWIFT PRIME, REVASCAT), there was favorable effect with mechanical<br>thrombectomy over standard care without heterogeneity of effect across patient age subgroups (for patients <70 and<br>≥70 years of age: OR, 2.41 [95% CI, 1.51–3.84] and 2.26 [95% CI, 1.20–4.26], respectively).191 However, the number<br>of patients in these trials who were ≥90 years of age was very small, and the benefit of mechanical thrombectomy<br>over standard care in patients ≥90 years of age is not clear. As with any treatment decision in an elderly patient,<br>consideration of comorbidities and risks should factor into the decision-making for mechanical thrombectomy. |     |     | See Tables XVII and XLV in online Data<br>Supplement 1. |

| Comparative available randomized data has assessed patients primarily in the therapeutic window within 6 hours of<br>onset.<br>The COMPASS (Comparison of Direct Aspiration Versus Stent Retriever as a First Approach) trial randomized patients<br>with (1) prestroke mRS score of 0 to 1; (2) causative occlusion of the internal carotid artery or M1; (3) age ≥18<br>years; (4) NIHSS score of ≥5; (5) ASPECTS ≥6; and (6) treatment can be initiated (groin puncture) within 6 hours of<br>symptom onset to aspiration thrombectomy or stentriever thrombectomy as first-line technique. Primary outcome<br>was noninferiority of mRS score at 90 days. An mRS score of 0 to 2 was achieved in 69 of 134 (52%) of patients<br>in the aspiration group and 67 of 136 (50%) in the stentriever group, demonstrating noninferiority of aspiration<br>thrombectomy compared with stentriever thrombectomy (Pnoninferiority=0.0014). No difference in recanalization rates or<br>intracranial hemorrhage was found.192<br>The ASTER trial (Contact Aspiration vs Stent Retriever for Successful Revascularization) compared the contact<br>aspiration technique and the standard stent retriever technique as first-line mechanical thrombectomy for successful<br>revascularization within 6 hours among patients with acute anterior circulation ischemic stroke and LVO. Eligibility<br>criteria were different from COMPASS, lacking specification of NIHSS or ASPECTS. Primary outcome was successful<br>revascularization. The proportion of patients with successful revascularization at the end of all interventions was<br>85.4% (n=164) in the contact aspiration group versus 83.1% (n=157) in the stent retriever group (OR, 1.20 [95% CI,<br>0.68–2.10]; P=0.53; difference, 2.4% [95% CI, −5.4 to 9.7]). The secondary clinical end point of mRS score of 0 to 2<br>at 90 days was achieved by 82 of 181 (45.3%) in the contact aspiration group versus 91 of 182 (50.0%) in the stent<br>retriever group (OR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.54–1.26]; P=0.38). Given its superiority design to detect a 15% difference in the<br>primary end point, this trial was not designed to establish noninferiority.193 The Penumbra Separator 3D Trial compared<br>a 3-D stent retriever combined with aspiration to aspiration alone as first-line intracranial mechanical thrombectomy<br>for successful revascularization within 8 hours among patients with AIS (NIHSS score of at least 8) and LVO refractory<br>to or ineligible for IV alteplase in a 1:1 randomized, noninferiority trial with a 15% noninferiority margin. The primary<br>end point of mTICI grade 2 to 3 occurred in 87.2% of the combination group versus 82.3% in the aspiration alone<br>group, meeting the noninferiority criterion of lower 90% confidence bound less than −15%. A 90-day mRS score of<br>aspiration alone group.194 The trial demonstrated noninferiority of 3-D stent retriever with aspiration versus aspiration<br>alone, using older-generation aspiration technology. The trial was not powered to demonstrate noninferiority in the<br>secondary outcome of 90-day functional independence. | See Table XVII in online Data<br>Supplement 1.          |      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Although the benefits are uncertain, the use of mechanical thrombectomy<br>with stent retrievers may be reasonable for carefully selected patients with<br>AIS in whom treatment can be initiated (groin puncture) within 6 hours of<br>symptom onset and who have causative occlusion of the MCA segment 2 (M2)<br>or MCA segment 3 (M3) portion of the MCAs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | IIb                                                     | B-R  | Recommendation reworded for<br>clarity from 2015 Endovascular.

| In pooled patient-level data from 5 trials (HERMES, which included the 5 trials MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, REVASCAT,<br>SWIFT PRIME, and EXTEND-IA), the direction of treatment effect for mechanical thrombectomy over standard care<br>was favorable in M2 occlusions, but the adjusted cOR was not significant (1.28 [95% CI, 0.51–3.21]).189 In patient<br>level data pooled from trials in which the Solitaire was the only or the predominant device used, a prespecified<br>meta-analysis (SEER Collaboration: SWIFT PRIME, ESCAPE, EXTEND-IA, and REVASCAT) showed that the direction<br>of treatment effect was favorable for mechanical thrombectomy over standard care in M2 occlusions, but the<br>OR and 95% CI were not significant.190 In an analysis of pooled data from SWIFT (Solitaire With the Intention for<br>Thrombectomy), STAR (Solitaire Flow Restoration Thrombectomy for Acute Revascularization), DEFUSE 2, and IMS III,<br>among patients with M2 occlusions, reperfusion was associated with excellent functional outcomes (mRS score 0–1;<br>OR, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.0–4.7]).195 Therefore, the recommendation for mechanical thrombectomy for M2/M3 occlusions<br>does not change substantively from the 2015 AHA/ASA focused update.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | See Tables XVII and XLV in online Data<br>Supplement 1. |      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| The DAWN trial used clinical-core mismatch (a combination of NIHSS score and imaging findings on CTP or DW-MRI)<br>as eligibility criteria to select patients with large anterior circulation vessel occlusion for treatment with mechanical<br>thrombectomy between 6 and 24 hours from last known normal. This trial demonstrated an overall benefit in function<br>outcome at 90 days in the treatment group (mRS score 0–2, 49% versus 13%; adjusted difference, 33% [95% CI,<br>21–44]; posterior probability of superiority >0.999).51 In DAWN, there were few strokes with witnessed onset (12%).<br>The DEFUSE 3 trial used perfusion-core mismatch and maximum core size as imaging criteria to select patients with<br>large anterior circulation occlusion 6 to 16 hours from last seen well for mechanical thrombectomy. This trial showed<br>a benefit in functional outcome at 90 days in the treated group (mRS score 0–2, 44.6% versus 16.7%; RR, 2.67<br>[95% CI, 1.60–4.48]; P<0.0001).52 Benefit was independently demonstrated for the subgroup of patients who met<br>DAWN eligibility criteria and for the subgroup who did not. DAWN and DEFUSE 3 are the only RCTs showing benefit of<br>mechanical thrombectomy >6 hours from onset. Therefore, only the eligibility criteria from one or the other of these<br>trials should be used for patient selection. Although future RCTs may demonstrate that additional eligibility criteria can<br>be used to select patients who benefit from mechanical thrombectomy, at this time, the DAWN or DEFUSE 3 eligibility<br>should be strictly adhered to in clinical practice.51,52 |     |     | See Table XVII in online Data<br>Supplement 1. |

| Mechanical thrombectomy aims to achieve reperfusion, not simply recanalization. A variety of reperfusion scores exist,<br>but the mTICI score is the current assessment tool of choice, with proven value in predicting clinical outcomes.196,197<br>All recent endovascular trials used the mTICI grade 2b/3 threshold for adequate reperfusion, with high rates achieved.<br>In HERMES, 402 of 570 patients (71%) were successfully reperfused to mTICI grade 2b/3.189 Earlier trials with<br>less efficient devices showed lower recanalization rates, a factor in their inability to demonstrate benefit from the<br>procedure (IMS III, 41%; MR RESCUE, 25%).

| In pooled patient-level data from 5 trials (HERMES, which included the 5 trials MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, REVASCAT, SWIFT<br>PRIME, and EXTEND-IA), the odds of better disability outcomes at 90 days (mRS scale distribution) with the mechanical<br>thrombectomy group declined with longer time from symptom onset to expected arterial puncture: cOR at 3 hours,<br>2.79 (95% CI, 1.96–3.98), ARD for lower disability scores, 39.2%; cOR at 6 hours, 1.98 (95% CI, 1.30–3.00), ARD,<br>30.2%; cOR at 8 hours, 1.57 (95% CI, 0.86–2.88), and ARD, 15.7%, retaining statistical significance through 7 hours<br>18 minutes.42 Among 390 patients who achieved substantial reperfusion with endovascular thrombectomy, each 1-hour<br>delay to reperfusion was associated with a less favorable degree of disability (cOR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.76–0.93]; ARD,<br>−6.7%) and less functional independence (OR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.71–0.92]; ARD, −5.2% [95% CI, −8.3 to −2.1]).42 The<br>6- to 16- and 6- to 24-hour treatment windows trials, which utilized advanced imaging to identify a relatively uniform<br>patient group, showed limited variability of treatment effect with time in these highly selected patients.51,52 The absence<br>of detailed screening logs in these trials limits estimations of the true impact of time in this population. To ensure the<br>highest proportion of eligible patients presenting in the 6- to 24-hour window have access to mechanical thrombectomy,<br>evaluation and treatment should be as rapid as possible. A variety of reperfusion scores exist, but the mTICI score is the<br>current assessment tool of choice, with proven value in predicting clinical outcomes.128,129 All recent endovascular trials<br>used the mTICI 2b/3 threshold for adequate reperfusion, with high rates achieved. In HERMES, 402 of 570 patients (71%)<br>were successfully reperfused to TICI 2b/3.189 Earlier trials with less efficient devices showed lower recanalization rates, 1<br>factor in their inability to demonstrate benefit from the procedure (IMS III, 41%; MR RESCUE, 25%). | See Tables XVII and XLV in online Data<br>Supplement 1. |     |                                                                                                                                      |

| Conscious sedation (CS) was the anesthetic modality widely used during endovascular procedures for acute stroke in<br>the recent endovascular trials (90.9% of ESCAPE, 63% of SWIFT PRIME) with no clear positive or negative impact on<br>outcome. In MR CLEAN, post hoc analysis showed a 51% (95% CI, 31–86) decrease in treatment effect with general<br>anesthesia (GA) compared with CS.198 In THRACE, 51 of 67 patients receiving GA and 43 of 69 patients receiving CS<br>during acute stroke endovascular procedures achieved mTICI grade 2b/3 (P=0.059) with no impact on functional<br>outcomes (35 of 67 patients with GA and 36 of 74 with CS had an mRS score of 0–2 at 90 days).109 Thirty-five of 67<br>patients with GA and 36 of 74 with CS during acute stroke endovascular procedures had mRS scores of 0 to 2 at 90<br>days.109 Although several retrospective studies suggest that GA for acute stroke endovascular procedures produces<br>worsening of functional outcomes, the limited available prospective randomized data do not support this. Three small<br>(≤150 participants each) single-center RCTs have compared GA with CS during acute stroke endovascular procedures.<br>All failed to show superiority of GA for the primary end point (2 clinical, 1 DW-MRI infarct growth), whereas 2 of the<br>3 showed better outcomes for GA for some of the many secondary clinical end points.199–201 Until further data are<br>available, either method of procedural sedation for acute stroke endovascular procedures is reasonable. |     |      | See Tables XLVI and XLVII in online Data<br>Supplement 1.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Intra-arterial fibrinolytic therapy played a limited role in the recent endovascular trials but was used as rescue<br>therapy, not initial treatment. In MR CLEAN, the EVT method was at the discretion of operator, with 40 of 233 treated<br>with alternative stent retrievers to Trevo and Solitaire or intra-arterial alteplase. Details are not available, but no<br>patients were treated with intra-arterial alteplase alone. Twenty-four of 233 (10.3%) had treatment with a second<br>modality. Treatment method had no impact on outcomes in this trial.206 In THRACE, an intra-arterial lytic was used<br>to a maximum dose of 0.3 mg/kg and allowed to establish goal reperfusion, only after mechanical thrombectomy<br>was attempted. A mean dose of 8.8 mg was administered in 15 of 141 patients receiving mechanical thrombectomy<br>(11%). There was no effect on outcomes compared with mechanical thrombectomy alone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |     |      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| There are very limited data to guide BP management during and after the procedure in patients who undergo<br>mechanical thrombectomy. RCT data on optimal BP management approaches in this setting are not available. The<br>vast majority of patients enrolled in <6-hour RCTs received IV alteplase, and the trial protocols stipulated management<br>according to local guidelines with BP ≤180/105 during and for 24 hours after the procedure for these participants.<br>Two trial protocols provided additional recommendations. The ESCAPE protocol states that SBP ≥150 mmHg is<br>probably useful in promoting and keeping collateral flow adequate while the artery remains occluded and that<br>controlling BP once reperfusion has been achieved and aiming for a normal BP for that individual is sensible. Labetalol<br>or an IV β-blocker such as metoprolol in low doses is recommended.105 The DAWN protocol recommends maintaining<br>SBP <140 mmHg in the first 24 hours in subjects who are reperfused after mechanical thrombectomy (defined as<br>achieving more than two-thirds MCA territory reperfusion).51 Further studies are needed to determine the optimal BP<br>target during and after mechanical thrombectomy. |     |      | See Table XVII in online Data<br>Supplement 1. |

| 1. Administration of aspirin is recommended in patients with AIS within 24 to 48<br>hours after onset. For those treated with IV alteplase, aspirin administration is<br>generally delayed until 24 hours later but might be considered in the presence<br>of concomitant conditions for which such treatment given in the absence<br>of IV alteplase is known to provide substantial benefit or withholding such<br>treatment is known to cause substantial risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | I   | A   | Recommendation revised from 2013 AIS<br>Guidelines.        |
| The safety and benefit of aspirin in the treatment of patients with AIS were established by 2 large clinical trials<br>administering doses between 160 and 300 mg.207,208 This has recently been confirmed by a large Cochrane review<br>of aspirin trials.209 In patients unsafe or unable to swallow, rectal or nasogastric administration is appropriate.<br>Limited data exist on the use of alternative antiplatelet agents in the treatment of AIS. However, in patients with a<br>contraindication to aspirin, administering alternative antiplatelet agents may be reasonable. A retrospective analysis<br>of consecutive ischemic stroke patients admitted to a single center in Seoul, South Korea, found no increased<br>risk of hemorrhage with early initiation of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy (<24 hours) after IV alteplase or<br>EVT compared with initiation >24 hours.177 However, this study may have been subject to selection bias, and<br>the timing of initiation of antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation should be made on an individual level, balancing<br>risk and benefit. The recommendation was modified from the previous guideline to remove the specific dosing<br>recommendation "initial dose is 325 mg" because previous clinical trials supporting its use for AIS included doses<br>of 160 to 300 mg. |     |     | See Tables XLII and XLVIII in online Data<br>Supplement 1. |

| Two independent multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have established the efficacy of<br>short-term dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent recurrent ischemic stroke in patients with minor stroke or high-risk<br>TIA. The CHANCE trial (Clopidogrel in High Risk Patients With Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events; N=5170)<br>conducted in China studied the efficacy of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy begun within 24 hours in patients with<br>minor stroke (NIHSS score ≤3) or high-risk TIA (ABCD2 [Age, Blood Pressure, Clinical Features, Duration, Diabetes]<br>score ≥4). The dosing regimen was clopidogrel at an initial dose of 300 mg followed by 75 mg/d for 90 days plus<br>aspirin at a dose of 75 mg/d for the first 21 days or placebo plus aspirin (75 mg/d for 90 days). All participants<br>received open-label aspirin at a clinician-determined dose of 75 to 300 mg on day 1. The primary outcome of<br>recurrent stroke at 90 days (ischemic or hemorrhagic) favored dual antiplatelet therapy over aspirin alone: hazard<br>ratio (HR), 0.68 (95% CI, 0.57–0.81; P<0.001).210 Post hoc analysis found a small but measurable reduction in poor<br>functional outcome (mRS score 2–6) on dual antiplatelet therapy compared with aspirin alone (absolute RR, 1.7%<br>[95% CI, 0.03%–3.42%]; P=0.046).211 However, a post hoc time-course analysis showed that the benefit in reducing<br>recurrent ischemic stroke compared with the risk of bleeding on dual antiplatelet therapy dissipated after ≈10 days<br>of treatment.212 A subsequent report of 1-year outcomes found a durable treatment effect, but the HR for secondary<br>stroke prevention was only significantly beneficial in the first 90 days.213 In addition, subgroup analyses found no<br>benefit of clopidogrel plus aspirin in carriers of a CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele214 or those with a single acute<br>infarction or no infarction compared with those with multiple acute infarctions,215 although these subgroup analyses<br>were likely underpowered.<br>The POINT trial (Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke; N=4881) was conducted in North<br>America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, with the majority (83%) enrolled in the United States (75% white, 20%<br>black).216 Similar to CHANCE, the target enrollment population included minor stroke (NIHSS score ≤3) or high-risk<br>TIA (ABCD2 score ≥4) within 12 hours of symptom onset. Patients were randomized to either clopidogrel plus aspirin<br>(600-mg loading dose of clopidogrel followed by 75 mg/d from day 2–90) plus open-label aspirin (50–325 mg/d)<br>versus aspirin alone (50–325 mg/d) for 90 days. The primary outcome was a composite of ischemic stroke, myocardial<br>infarction (MI), or death resulting from an ischemic vascular event up to 90 days, with a secondary safety end point of<br>major hemorrhage during the same time period. Compared with aspirin alone, aspirin plus clopidogrel resulted in fewer<br>ischemic events (5% versus 6.5%; HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.59–0.95]; P=0.02) but more major hemorrhages (0.9% versus<br>0.4%; HR, 2.32 [95% CI, 1.10–4.87]; P=0.02). Overall, the beneficial effect of aspirin plus clopidogrel was driven by a<br>reduction in ischemic stroke (HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.56–0.92]; P=0.01) and greatest in the first 30 days of treatment from<br>symptom onset (HR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.56–0.95]; P=0.02). However, the risk of major hemorrhage was greatest after the<br>first 7 days of treatment (HR, 2.69 [95% CI, 1.05–6.86]; P=0.04). There was no significant added benefit of aspirin plus<br>clopidogrel after 30 days of treatment. In addition, in a prespecified analysis of functional outcomes determined by 90-<br>day mRS score ≥2 for new disability, there was no difference between groups (HR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.82–1.14]; P=0.71). |                                                  |     | See Table XLVIII in online Data<br>Supplement 1.            |

With a primary outcome of<br>time to the composite end point of stroke, MI, or death up to 90 days, ticagrelor was not found to be superior to aspirin<br>(HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.78–1.01]; P=0.07).219 However, because there were no significant safety differences in the 2<br>groups, ticagrelor may be a reasonable alternative in stroke patients who have a contraindication to aspirin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | See Table XLVIII in online Data<br>Supplement 1. |     |                                                             |

| The optimal medical management of patients with AIS and radiologic evidence of nonocclusive, intraluminal thrombus<br>(eg, cervical carotid, vertebrobasilar arteries) remains uncertain. Several small observational studies have suggested<br>the safety of short-term IV heparin or LMWH in this setting,222,223 but further research is required to establish safety<br>and efficacy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | See Table XLIX in online Data<br>Supplement 1.        |      |                                                                                                                                                    |

| Several observational studies have demonstrated the safety and feasibility of treating AIS with thrombin inhibitors<br>as either a single or an adjunct therapy to alteplase. The oral direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran was studied in 53<br>patients with TIA or minor stroke (NIHSS score ≤3) with no occurrences of sICH up to 30 days.224 ARTSS (Argatroban<br>With Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Acute Stroke)-1 was an open-label, pilot safety study of argatroban<br>infusion plus IV alteplase in 65 patients with complete or partially occlusive thrombus diagnosed by transcranial<br>Doppler.225 In the ARTSS-2 phase II study, patients with AIS treated with alteplase (N=90) were randomized to receive<br>placebo or argatroban (100-µg/kg bolus), followed by infusion of either 1 (low dose) or 3 (high dose) µg/kg per minute for<br>48 hours. Rates of sICH were similar among the control, low-dose, and high-dose arms: 3 of 29 (10%), 4 of 30 (13%),<br>and 2 of 31 (7%), respectively.226 Further trials are necessary to clarify the safety and efficacy of this intervention. | See Tables XLIX and L in online Data<br>Supplement 1. |      |                                                                                                                                                    |

| Further support for this unchanged recommendation from the 2013 AIS Guidelines is provided by 2 updated meta<br>analyses that confirm the lack of benefit of urgent anticoagulation.228,229 An additional study, not included in these<br>meta-analyses, investigated the efficacy of LMWH compared with aspirin in preventing early neurological deterioration<br>in an unblinded RCT. Although there was a statistically significant difference in early neurological deterioration at 10<br>days after admission (LMWH, 27 [3.95%] versus aspirin, 81 [11.82%]; P<0.001), there was no difference in 6-month<br>mRS score of 0 to 2 (LMWH, 64.2% versus aspirin, 62.5%; P=0.33).230                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                       |      | See Table L in online Data Supplement<br>1.                                                                                                        |

| There have been myriad attempts to establish the efficacy of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions<br>with putative neuroprotective action in acute stroke that have failed when tested in human clinical trials. Since the<br>2013 AIS Guidelines, there have been several more trials testing putative neuroprotective agents that have been<br>negative. The FAST-MAG trial (Field Administration of Stroke Therapy–Magnesium) of prehospital magnesium<br>infusion was the first acute stroke neuroprotection drug trial to enroll participants during ambulance transport, but no<br>differences were seen between the intervention group and placebo control subjects.235 The ALIAS trials parts I and II<br>failed to show the efficacy of IV albumin infusion in AIS.232,233 |                    |     | See Table LII in online Data Supplement<br>1.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Previous data suggested that transcranial near-infrared laser therapy for stroke held promise as a therapeutic<br>intervention through data published in NEST (Neurothera Effectiveness and Safety Trial)-1 and NEST-2.236–238 Such basic<br>science and preclinical data culminated in the NEST-3 trial, which was a prospective RCT. This trial investigated the use<br>of transcranial laser therapy for the treatment of ischemic stroke between 4.5 and 24 hours of stroke onset in patients<br>with moderate stroke (NIHSS score 7–17) who did not receive IV alteplase.239 This study was terminated because of<br>futility after analysis of the first 566 patients found no benefit of transcranial laser therapy over sham treatment. There is<br>currently no evidence that transcranial laser therapy is beneficial in the treatment of ischemic stroke. |                    |     | See Table LIV in online Data Supplement<br>1.       |

| Only 1 sizable trial has evaluated the effect on functional outcomes of flat versus elevated head position after a stroke.<br>HeadPoST (Head Positioning in Acute Stroke Trial) was a large international, cluster-randomized, crossover open<br>label trial that enrolled any patient hospitalized for stroke (including ICHs) admitted to the hospital to flat-head (0°)<br>or elevated head (≥30°) maintained for 24 hours after randomization.240 Distribution of mRS scores at 90 days did<br>not differ between the groups (OR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.92–1.10]; P=0.84). Patients in the flat-head position group were<br>less often able to maintain the assigned head position for 24 hours, but rates of pneumonia did not differ between<br>the 2 groups. However, this pragmatic trial has been criticized because of various limitations.241 HeadPoST enrolled<br>predominantly patients with minor strokes (median NIHSS score 4) who would be less likely to benefit from increased<br>perfusion compared with patients with more severe strokes and large artery occlusions. In addition, the initiation of<br>the intervention was very delayed (median, 14 hours), potentially missing the window in which head positioning could<br>have made a difference. Several small studies have shown that the lying-flat position may improve cerebral perfusion<br>in patients with AIS caused by a large artery occlusion when the intervention is initiated early after stroke onset.241,242<br>Thus, there is a rationale for further research focused on this specific cohort of patients. |     |     | See Table LV in online Data Supplement<br>1. |

| Patients with AIS can present with severe acute comorbidities that demand emergency BP reduction to prevent serious<br>complications. However, it is important to keep in mind that excessive BP lowering can sometimes worsen cerebral<br>ischemia.243 Ideal management in these situations should be individualized, but in general, initial BP reduction by 15%<br>is a reasonable goal. There are no data to show that one strategy to lower BP is better than another after AIS. The<br>medications and doses in Table 5 are all reasonable options.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                    |      |                                                     |
| 3. In patients with BP ≥220/120 mmHg who did not receive IV alteplase or<br>mechanical thrombectomy and have no comorbid conditions requiring urgent<br>antihypertensive treatment, the benefit of initiating or reinitiating treatment<br>of hypertension within the first 48 to 72 hours is uncertain. It might be<br>reasonable to lower BP by 15% during the first 24 hours after onset of stroke.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | IIb                | C-EO | New recommendation.                                 |
| Patients with severe hypertension (most commonly >220/120 mmHg) were excluded from clinical trials evaluating<br>BP lowering after AIS.244–249 Rapid BP reduction has traditionally been advised for these cases, but the benefit of such<br>treatment in the absence of comorbid conditions that may be acutely exacerbated by severe hypertension has not been<br>formally studied. Ideal management in these situations should be individualized, but in general, initial BP reduction by 15%<br>is a reasonable goal. Excessive drop in BP could result in complications such as stroke progression (by compromising<br>cerebral perfusion in penumbral tissue) and acute kidney injury (from renal hypoperfusion). There are no data to show that<br>one strategy to lower BP is better than another after AIS. The medications and doses in Table 5 are all reasonable options. |                    |      | See Table LVI in online Data Supplement<br>1.       |

In patients with BP <220/120 mmHg who did not receive IV alteplase or<br>mechanical thrombectomy and do not have a comorbid condition requiring<br>urgent antihypertensive treatment, initiating or reinitiating treatment of<br>hypertension within the first 48 to 72 hours after an AIS is not effective to<br>prevent death or dependency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | III: No<br>Benefit | A    | Recommendation revised from 2013 AIS<br>Guidelines. |
| Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses of these trials244–258 have consistently shown that initiating or reinitiating antihypertensive<br>therapy within the first 48 to 72 hours after an AIS is safe, but this strategy is not associated with improved mortality or<br>functional outcomes. However, none of these trials were designed to study BP reduction within the first 6 hours after<br>stroke, and all excluded patients with extreme hypertension or coexistent indications for rapid BP reduction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                    |      | See Table LVI in online Data Supplement<br>1.       |

| 1.Dysphagia screening before the patient begins eating, drinking, or receiving<br>oral medications is effective to identify patients at increased risk for<br>aspiration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | I   | C-LD | New recommendation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Dysphagia, a common (37%–78%) complication of acute stroke, is a risk factor for aspiration pneumonia and<br>is associated with higher mortality and worse patient outcomes. The Evidence Review Committee completed<br>a systematic review to determine whether dysphagia screening, compared with no screening or usual care,<br>decreased outcomes of pneumonia, death, or dependency.3,259–261 There were insufficient data to determine whether<br>implementation of a dysphagia screening protocol reduces the risk of death or dependency. However, insufficient<br>evidence does not mean that dysphagia screening is ineffective. Joundi et al262 determined that patients who failed<br>dysphagia screening were older, had a higher rate of multiple comorbidities (including prior stroke and dementia),<br>more often came from a long-term care facility, more often presented with weakness and speech deficits, had a<br>lower level of consciousness, and had a higher stroke severity. Patients who failed dysphagia screening were more<br>likely to develop pneumonia (13.1% versus 1.9%), to have more severe disability (52.4% versus 18.0%), and to<br>be discharged to a long-term care institution (14.0% versus 4.3%). Early dysphagia screening can be effective to<br>identify patients at higher risk for aspiration, which is associated with greater risk of pneumonia, even if dysphagia<br>screening was not associated with reduced rates of pneumonia or improvements in death or disability when tested<br>in RCTs.259–261 |     |      | See Tables LVII and LVIII in online Data<br>Supplement 1.                                                                                                                                                                                       |

An endoscopic evaluation is reasonable for those patients suspected of<br>aspiration to verify the presence/absence of aspiration and to determine the<br>physiological reasons for the dysphagia to guide the treatment plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | IIa | B-NR | Recommendation wording modified<br>from 2016 Rehab Guidelines to match<br>COR IIa stratifications.

It is not well established which instrument to choose for evaluation of<br>swallowing with sensory testing, but the choice may be based on instrument<br>availability or other considerations (ie, fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of<br>swallowing, videofluoroscopy, fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation with sensory<br>testing).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | IIb | C-LD | Recommendation reworded for clarity<br>from 2016 Rehab Guidelines.

| Limited studies suggest that intensive oral hygiene protocols might reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia. In patients with<br>acute stroke, Sørensen et al263 showed that intervention with standardized dysphagia screening and diet and standardized<br>oral hygiene with antibacterial mouth rinse with chlorhexidine reduced pneumonia (7% versus 28%) compared with a<br>historical control group in which patients were unsystematically screened for dysphagia within 24 hours and received<br>unsystematic and arbitrary oral hygiene without chlorhexidine. In this experimental design, the efficacy of the standardized<br>oral hygiene portion in the intervention group could not be separated from the standardized dysphagia screening and diet.<br>Furthermore, because of the historic nature of the control group, it is possible that other changes in care that could have<br>occurred between the historical control subjects and the intervention group might have affected the risk for development of<br>pneumonia. A Cochrane review that included 3 studies found that oral care and decontamination gel versus oral care and<br>placebo gel reduced the incidence of pneumonia in the intervention group (P=0.03).264 Wagner et al265 conducted a cohort<br>study comparing rates of pneumonia in hospitalized stroke patients before and after implementation of systematic oral<br>hygiene care. The unadjusted incidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia was lower in the group assigned to oral hygiene<br>care compared with control subjects (14% versus 10.33%; P=0.022), with an unadjusted OR of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.48–0.95;<br>P=0.022). After adjustment for confounders, the OR of hospital-acquired pneumonia in the intervention group remained<br>significantly lower at 0.71 (95% CI, 0.51–0.98; P=0.041). |     |      | See Tables LIX and LX in online Data<br>Supplement 1. |

For patients with dysphagia, it is reasonable to initially use nasogastric tubes<br>for feeding in the early phase of stroke (starting within the first 7 days) and<br>to place percutaneous gastrostomy tubes in patients with longer anticipated<br>persistent inability to swallow safely (>2–3 weeks).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | IIa | C-EO | New recommendation.                                                                                                                                  |
| The FOOD RCTs (Feed or Ordinary Diet; phases I–III), completed in 131 hospitals in 18 countries,266 showed that<br>supplemented diet was associated with an absolute reduction in risk of death of 0.7% and that early tube feeding<br>(within 7 days of admission) was associated with an absolute reduction in risk of death of 5.8% and a reduction<br>in death or poor outcomes of 1.2%. When nasogastric feeding and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy feeding<br>were compared, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy feeding was associated with an increase in absolute risk of<br>death of 1.0% and an increased risk of death or poor outcomes of 7.8%. The conclusion was that stroke patients<br>should be started on enteral diet within the first 7 days of admission.266 In 2012, a Cochrane review analyzed 33 RCTs<br>involving 6779 patients to assess the intervention for dysphagia treatment, feeding strategies and timing (early [within<br>7 days] versus later), fluid supplementation, and the effects of nutritional supplementation on acute and subacute<br>stroke patients.267 The conclusion was that, although data remained insufficient to offer definitive answers, available<br>information suggested that percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy feeding and nasogastric tube feeding do not differ<br>in terms of case fatality, death, or dependency, but percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is associated with fewer<br>treatment failures (P=0.007), less gastrointestinal bleeding (P=0.007), and higher food delivery (P<0.00001). |     |      | See Table LXI in online Data Supplement<br>1.                                                                                                        |

In immobile stroke patients without contraindications, intermittent pneumatic<br>compression (IPC) in addition to routine care (aspirin and hydration) is<br>recommended over routine care to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | I                                              | B-R | Recommendation revised from 2016<br>Rehab Guidelines. |
| CLOTS (Clots in Legs or stockings After Stroke) 3 was a multicenter trial enrolling 2867 patients in 94 centers in the United<br>Kingdom and comparing the use of IPC with routine care and no IPC with routine care in immobile stroke patients for venous<br>thromboembolism prophylaxis. Eligible patients were enrolled within 3 days of the acute stroke and could not mobilize to<br>the toilet without the help of another person. Routine care was defined as the use of aspirin for nonhemorrhagic stroke,<br>hydration, and possible compression stockings. A total of 31% of the patients received prophylactic or full-dose heparin or<br>LMWH, but these patients were evenly distributed between both groups. After the exclusion of 323 patients who died before<br>any primary outcome and 41 who had no screening, the primary outcome of DVT occurred in 122 of 1267 participants with<br>IPC (9.6%) compared with 174 of 1245 participants without IPC (14.0%), giving an adjusted OR of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.51–0.84;<br>P=0.001). Among patients treated with IPC, there was a statistically significant improvement in survival to 6 months (HR,<br>0.86 [95% CI, 0.73–0.99]; P=0.042) but no improvement in disability. Skin breaks were more common in the IPC group<br>(3.1% versus 1.4%; P=0.002). Contraindications to IPC include leg conditions such as dermatitis, gangrene, severe edema,<br>venous stasis, severe peripheral vascular disease, postoperative vein ligation, or grafting, as well as existing swelling or other<br>signs of an existing DVT.268 A meta-analysis including this trial and 2 smaller trials confirmed these results.269 | See Table LXII in online Data<br>Supplement 1. |     |                                                       |

| The most recent and comprehensive meta-analysis comparing LMWH or heparinoid with UFH for venous<br>thromboembolism prophylaxis in AIS included 1 large trial (N=1762) and 2 smaller trials comparing LMWH with<br>UFH and 4 small trials comparing heparinoids with UFH. There were no significant effects on death or disability for<br>LMWH/heparinoids compared with UFH.269 The use of LMWH/heparinoid was associated with a statistically significant<br>reduction in DVTs (OR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.44–0.70]), which were mostly asymptomatic, at the expense of a greater risk<br>of major extracranial hemorrhages (OR, 3.79 [95% CI, 1.30–11.03]).

| A meta-analysis of studies assessing poststroke depression screening tools (24 studies, N=2907) found several<br>inventories with high sensitivity for detecting poststroke depression.270 Two of these studies evaluated patients in<br>the acute phase 2 weeks after onset and found that depression screening tools showed good accuracy compared<br>with the reference standard diagnosis by the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of<br>Mental Disorders.<br>271,272 However, further studies are needed to determine the optimal timing, setting, and follow-up for<br>screening.16                                         |     |      | See Tables LXIII and LXIV in online Data<br>Supplement 1.                                                                                               |

| Clinical trials of antidepressants in individuals with poststroke depression have shown a beneficial effect on<br>depression remission and response, but trials were limited by small samples, variable criteria for poststroke<br>depression, and vague definitions for remission and response.16 Several trials have indicated a benefit of<br>psychosocial therapies for treatment.16 In an RCT, participants who underwent screening in the early subacute period<br>1 to 2 months after stroke followed by treatment with counseling antidepressant medication showed significantly<br>lower 12-week depression scores than those who received usual care.273 |     |      | See Tables LXV and LXVI in online Data<br>Supplement 1.                                                                                                 |

| The AVERT RCT (A Very Early Rehabilitation Trial) compared high-dose, very early mobilization with standard-of-care<br>mobility.279 High-dose mobilization protocol interventions included the following: Mobilization was begun within 24 hours<br>of stroke onset, whereas usual care typically was 24 hours after the onset of stroke; there was a focus on sitting, standing,<br>and walking activity; and there were at least 3 additional out-of-bed sessions compared with usual care. Favorable<br>outcome at 3 months after stroke was defined as an mRS score of 0 to 2. A total of 2104 patients were randomly<br>assigned (1:1). The results of this RCT showed that patients in the high-dose, very early mobilization group had less<br>favorable outcomes (46% versus 50%) than those in the usual care group: 8% versus 7% of patients died in the very early<br>mobilization group, and 19% versus 20% had a nonfatal serious adverse event with high-dose, very early mobilization. |           |     | See Table LXVIII in online Data<br>Supplement 1.                                                                                                                                                     |

| 1. Patients with large territorial cerebral and cerebellar infarctions are at high<br>risk for developing brain swelling and herniation. Discussion of care options<br>and possible outcomes should take place quickly with patients (if possible)<br>and family or next of kin.

| Brain swelling can cause serious and even life-threatening complications in patients with large territorial cerebral and<br>cerebellar infarctions. Although less severe swelling can be managed medically, surgical treatment may be the only<br>effective option for very severe cases; in such instances, timely decompressive surgery has been shown to reduce<br>mortality.280 Nevertheless, there is evidence that persistent morbidity is common, and individual preexisting decisions<br>about end-of-life and degree of treatment performed in the face of severe neurological injury must be considered. |     |      | See Tables LXIX and LXX in online Data<br>Supplement 1.                                                                                                                |
| 2. Measures to lessen the risk of swelling and close monitoring of the patient<br>for signs of neurological worsening during the first days after stroke<br>are recommended. Early transfer of patients at risk for malignant brain<br>swelling to an institution with appropriate neurosurgical expertise should be<br>considered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | I   | C-LD | Recommendation reworded for brevity<br>and consistency from 2013 AIS<br>Guidelines.

| 1. Ventriculostomy is recommended in the treatment of obstructive<br>hydrocephalus after cerebellar infarction. Concomitant or subsequent<br>decompressive craniectomy may or may not be necessary on the basis of<br>factors such as the size of the infarction, neurological condition, degree of<br>brainstem compression, and effectiveness of medical management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | I   | C-LD | Recommendation revised from 2014<br>Brain Swelling. |
| Ventriculostomy is a well-recognized effective treatment for the management of acute obstructive hydrocephalus and<br>is often effective in isolation in relieving symptoms, even among patients with acute cerebellar infarction.289,296 Thus, in<br>patients who develop symptoms of obstructive hydrocephalus from cerebellar infarction, emergency ventriculostomy is<br>a reasonable first step in the surgical management paradigm. If cerebrospinal fluid diversion by ventriculostomy fails<br>to improve neurological function, decompressive suboccipital craniectomy should be performed.289,296,297 Although a<br>risk of upward herniation exists with ventriculostomy alone, it can be minimized with conservative cerebrospinal fluid<br>drainage or subsequent decompression if the cerebellar infarction causes significant swelling and mass effect.289,296 |     |      | See Table LXIX in online Data<br>Supplement 1.      |
| 2. Decompressive suboccipital craniectomy with dural expansion should<br>be performed in patients with cerebellar infarction causing neurological<br>deterioration from brainstem compression despite maximal medical therapy.<br>When deemed safe and indicated, obstructive hydrocephalus should be<br>treated concurrently with ventriculostomy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | I   | B-NR | Recommendation revised from 2014<br>Brain Swelling. |

| NCCT scanning of patients with acute stroke is effective for the detection of acute ICH and the avoidance of<br>antithrombotic treatment in these patients.85 In many patients, the diagnosis of ischemic stroke can be made<br>accurately on the basis of the clinical presentation and either a negative NCCT or one showing early ischemic changes,<br>which can be detected in the majority of patients with careful attention.82,83,298 Many RCTs that provide the current<br>best evidence for secondary stroke prevention treatments did not require MRI for patient selection.207,210,216,219,299–306<br>The benefits shown in these RCTs can be expected when the same eligibility criteria are applied without the addition<br>of MRI. DW-MRI is more sensitive than CT for detecting AIS,70,71 but there are inadequate data at this time to identify<br>which patients will benefit from brain MRI in addition to or instead of NCCT to improve effectiveness of treatment<br>for prevention of recurrent stroke. A systematic review in 2012 identified almost no direct evidence that MRI affects<br>outcome in patients with stroke and limited evidence that MRI affects management.307 A decision-analytical model<br>of patients with TIA and minor stroke concluded that routine use of MRI did not improve outcome except for patients<br>presenting at >1 week after symptoms to diagnose hemorrhage.308 Two studies from the 1990s evaluating repeat<br>neuroimaging recommended repeat CT over additional MRI for most clinical situations in AIS with the exceptions<br>of documenting lacunar and infratentorial infarcts, but they did not present evidence of a benefit on outcome for<br>these situations.309,310 For instance, 2 situations in which MRI can be useful to select treatments that have been<br>demonstrated by RCTs to improve outcome are (1) patients with carotid stenosis who are potential candidates for<br>carotid revascularization in whom NCCT or neurological examination (eg, pure motor hemiparesis) does not permit<br>accurate localization and (2) patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO) who are potential candidates for mechanical<br>closure (see below). |     |      | See Tables XVIII and LXXIII in online Data<br>Supplement 1.    |

Brain MRI is reasonable in selected patients as part of a comprehensive<br>evaluation to determine if they meet the eligibility criteria of the RCTs that<br>investigated mechanical closure of PFO for prevention of recurrent stroke.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | IIa | B-R  | New recommendation.                                            |
| Six RCTs have evaluated mechanical closure of echocardiographically detected PFO to prevent recurrent stroke in<br>patients without obvious cause for their index stroke.311–317 These trials had highly restrictive eligibility criteria that<br>required brain MRI, imaging of the intracranial vasculature, and echocardiography. Meta-analyses of these trials show<br>a significantly reduced risk of recurrent stroke with mechanical closure compared with medical therapy with a number<br>needed to treat of 131.318–320 A network meta-analysis concluded that, in patients <60 years of age, PFO closure<br>probably confers an important reduction in ischemic stroke recurrence compared with antiplatelet therapy alone but<br>may make no difference compared with anticoagulation. PFO closure also incurs a risk of persistent atrial fibrillation<br>and device-related adverse events. Compared with alternatives, anticoagulation probably increases major bleeding.319<br>Each of these 6 trials had ≥1 methodological features with a high risk of bias identified, including lack of blinding<br>of participants and personnel, lack of blinding of outcome assessments, incomplete outcome data, and selective<br>reporting.318–324                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |     |      | See Tables LXXV through LXXVII in<br>online Data Supplement 1. |

For patients with nondisabling (mRS score 0–2) AIS in the carotid territory<br>who are candidates for CEA or stenting, noninvasive imaging of the cervical<br>carotid arteries should be performed routinely within 24 hours of admission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | I                                                 | B-NR | New recommendation.        |
| Past data have indicated that the risk of recurrent stroke caused by symptomatic carotid stenosis is highest early after<br>the initial event.325–329 Although there is evidence that early or emergency revascularization via either CEA or carotid<br>angioplasty and stenting may be safe in selected cases,330–332 there are no high-quality prospective data supporting<br>early versus late carotid revascularization in all cases.333 In cases of nondisabling stroke, a meta-analysis by De Rango<br>et al326 demonstrates high rates of complications when treated <48 hours after the initial event and no difference in<br>risks when treated between 0 and 7 days and 0 and 15 days.

| 2. For prevention of recurrent stroke, the use of intracranial vessel imaging is<br>reasonable in some patients with AIS to provide additional information to<br>guide selection of appropriate secondary stroke prevention treatments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | IIa | C-EO | New recommendation.                                            |
| An extensive literature search did not yield adequate data to identify subgroups of patients with AIS for whom<br>information obtained from intracranial vessel imaging will lead to improved outcome. There is no RCT evidence that<br>patients with AIS and symptomatic intracranial stenosis should be treated differently from other patients with ischemic<br>stroke of presumed atherosclerotic cause. In the WASID RCT (Warfarin-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease),<br>warfarin provided no benefit over aspirin 325 mg/d, even in those who were taking antithrombotics at the time of<br>the qualifying event.335 The SAMMPRIS trial (Stenting and Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent<br>Stroke in Intracranial Stenosis) showed no benefit of adding Wingspan stenting to aggressive medical therapy that<br>included aspirin 325 mg/d and clopidogrel 75 mg/d for 90 days after enrollment, again even in those who were taking<br>antithrombotics at the time of qualifying event.336–338 The CHANCE trial, which compared dual antiplatelet treatment<br>with clopidogrel and aspirin and aspirin alone for 21 days in patients with high-risk TIA and minor stroke, showed<br>no evidence of preferential benefit from dual antiplatelet treatment in patients with intracranial arterial stenosis.<br>Compared with pooled historical control subjects in WASID, the medical treatment–only group in SAMMPRIS had<br>an almost 2-fold lower risk of any stroke or death within 30 days or ischemic stroke in the territory of the qualifying<br>artery after 30 days. Whether this was the result of dual antiplatelet treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel for 90 days<br>remains to be demonstrated by an RCT.337–339 |     |      | See Tables LXXIX and LXXX in online<br>Data Supplement 1.      |
| 3. Imaging of the intracranial vasculature to detect atherosclerotic stenosis<br>of a major intracranial artery is reasonable in selected patients as part of a<br>comprehensive evaluation to determine if they meet the eligibility criteria<br>of the RCTs that investigated mechanical closure of PFO for prevention of<br>recurrent stroke.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | IIa | B-R  | New recommendation.                                            |
| Six RCTs have evaluated mechanical closure of echocardiographically detected PFO to prevent recurrent stroke in<br>patients without obvious cause for their index stroke.311–317 These trials had highly restrictive eligibility criteria that<br>required brain MRI, imaging of the intracranial vasculature, and echocardiography. Meta-analyses of these trials show<br>a significantly reduced risk of recurrent stroke with mechanical closure compared with medical therapy with a number<br>needed to treat of 131.318–320 A network meta-analysis concluded that, in patients <60 years of age, PFO closure<br>probably confers an important reduction in ischemic stroke recurrence compared with antiplatelet therapy alone but<br>may make no difference compared with anticoagulation. PFO closure also incurs a risk of persistent atrial fibrillation<br>and device-related adverse events. Compared with alternatives, anticoagulation probably increases major bleeding.319<br>Each of these 6 trials had ≥1 methodological features with a high risk of bias identified, including lack of blinding<br>of participants and personnel, lack of blinding of outcome assessments, incomplete outcome data, and selective<br>reporting.318–324                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |     |      | See Tables LXXV through LXXVII in<br>online Data Supplement 1. |

| 1. Cardiac monitoring is recommended to screen for atrial fibrillation and other<br>potentially serious cardiac arrhythmias that would necessitate emergency<br>cardiac interventions. Cardiac monitoring should be performed for at least<br>the first 24 hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | I   | B-NR | Recommendation and COR unchanged<br>from 2013 AIS Guidelines.

| Further support for this unchanged recommendation from the 2013 AIS Guidelines is provided by 2 additional studies<br>published since the 2013 guidelines. Kallmünzer et al340 prospectively monitored by cardiac telemetry 501 patients<br>with acute stroke (92% with cerebral ischemia) for a median of 73 hours after admission to a dedicated stroke unit.<br>A total of 139 serious arrhythmias were detected in 126 patients (25.1%). Atrial fibrillation accounted for 24 of 139<br>(17%) of the arrhythmias. Detection of arrhythmia led to direct antiarrhythmic treatment in 77.7%. In that study,<br>52.2% of all detected arrhythmias occurred within 12 hours and 74.4% within 24 hours after admission. Fernández<br>Menéndez et al341 prospectively monitored by cardiac telemetry for a minimum of 48 hours 332 patients admitted<br>to the stroke unit with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke, TIA, or intraparenchymal hemorrhage (90% with cerebral<br>ischemia) admitted within 48 hours of symptom onset. One hundred seventy-four significant cardiac arrhythmias<br>occurred in 98 patients (29.5%). Atrial fibrillation/flutter accounted for 23 of 174 (13%) of the arrhythmias. Thirty<br>three of 98 (34%) patients were directly treated for the arrhythmia (excluding anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation).<br>Thirty-seven percent of all detected arrhythmias occurred on day 1, 29% on day 2, and 15% on day 3.341 |     |      | See Table LXXXI in online Data<br>Supplement 1.                                                                                                    |

| In patients with TIA or ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation detected by routine ECG at the time or within the preceding<br>24 months, oral anticoagulation begun within 3 months is superior to aspirin for the prevention of vascular death,<br>stroke, MI, and systemic embolism (HR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.41–0.87]).342 With prolonged cardiac monitoring during<br>hospitalization, atrial fibrillation is newly detected in nearly a quarter of patients with stroke or TIA.343 No RCTs have<br>specifically evaluated the benefit of anticoagulation in patients with brief episodes of subclinical atrial fibrillation<br>detected in hospital after AIS. In CRYSTAL AF (Study of Continuous Cardiac Monitoring to Assess Atrial Fibrillation<br>After Cryptogenic Stroke), at 36 months, atrial fibrillation was detected in 30% of 221 patients with implantable<br>cardiac monitors and in 3% of 220 control subjects (P<0.001), but the occurrence of TIA or ischemic stroke was 9%<br>in the implantable cardiac monitor group and 11% in the control group (P=0.64).344,345 In Find-AFRANDOMISED (Finding<br>Atrial Fibrillation in Stroke–Evaluation of Enhanced and Prolonged Holter Monitoring), atrial fibrillation was detected in<br>14% of 200 patients with 10-day Holter monitoring at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months versus 5% of 198 patients<br>in the standard care group who had at least 24 hours of rhythm monitoring (P=0.002).

| 1. For prevention of recurrent stroke, the use of echocardiography is reasonable<br>in some patients with AIS to provide additional information to guide selection<br>of appropriate secondary stroke prevention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | IIa | C-EO | New recommendation.                                            |
| In many patients, appropriate evidence-based treatment for secondary prevention can be selected without the<br>use of echocardiography. Many RCTs that provide the current best evidence for secondary prevention treatments<br>did not require echocardiography for patient selection. These include NASCET (North American Symptomatic<br>Carotid Endarterectomy Trial), ECST (European Carotid Surgery Trial), IST, SALT (Swedish Aspirin Low-dose Trial),<br>CAPRIE (Clopidogrel versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischaemic Events), ESPS2 (European Stroke Prevention<br>Study 2), PRoFESS (Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes), CHANCE, PROGRESS (Perindopril<br>Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study), SPARCL (Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol<br>Levels), SOCRATES, POINT, and TARDIS (Triple Antiplatelets for Reducing Dependency After Ischaemic Stro<br>ke).207,210,216,219,299–306,350 The benefits shown in these RCTs can be expected when the same eligibility criteria are<br>applied. Those patients with known or newly discovered atrial fibrillation by routine ECG will benefit from oral<br>anticoagulation regardless of echocardiographic findings.342 Intracardiac thrombus occurs almost exclusively in<br>patients with clinical evidence of heart disease but is rare even in them. Echocardiography for detecting intracardiac<br>thrombus in unselected patients will produce at least as many false-positive as true-positive diagnoses.351 In large<br>series of patients with AIS who underwent echocardiography, the reported yield of important potentially cardioembolic<br>sources has ranged from 0.2% to 55% (Table LXXXV in online Data Supplement 1). Much of this discrepancy is the<br>result of differences in categorization of cardiac pathology as either pathophysiologically or therapeutically relevant.<br>The efficacy of treatment in reducing the risk of recurrent stroke associated with many of these echocardiographic<br>lesions is unknown, or there is not a treatment that has been shown to be better than standard medical therapy.352–360<br>Different authors have concluded that routine echocardiography is indicated or contraindicated. Various inconsistent<br>recommendations for selecting which patients with AIS should undergo echocardiography have been made.358,361–363<br>Six RCTs have evaluated mechanical closure of echocardiographically detected PFO to prevent recurrent stroke in<br>patients without an obvious cause for their index stroke.311–317 These trials had highly restrictive eligibility criteria.

| Six RCTs have evaluated mechanical closure of echocardiographically detected PFO to prevent recurrent stroke in<br>patients without an obvious cause for their index stroke.311–317 These trials had highly restrictive eligibility criteria that<br>required brain MRI, imaging of the intracranial vasculature, and echocardiography. Meta-analyses of these trials show<br>a significantly reduced risk of recurrent stroke with mechanical closure compared with medical therapy with a number<br>needed to treat of 131.318–320 A network meta-analysis concluded that, in patients <60 years of age, PFO closure probably<br>confers an important reduction in ischemic stroke recurrence compared with antiplatelet therapy alone but may make no<br>difference compared with anticoagulation. PFO closure also incurs a risk of persistent atrial fibrillation and device-related<br>adverse events. Compared with alternatives, anticoagulation probably increases major bleeding.319 Each of these 6 trials<br>had ≥1 methodological features with a high risk of bias identified, including lack of blinding of participants and personnel,<br>lack of blinding of outcome assessments, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting.318–324                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |     |      | See Tables LXXV through LXXVII in<br>online Data Supplement 1. |

| 1. After AIS, it is reasonable to screen all patients for diabetes mellitus with<br>testing of fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c, or an oral glucose<br>tolerance test. Choice of test and timing should be guided by clinical<br>judgment and recognition that acute illness may temporarily perturb<br>measures of plasma glucose. In general, hemoglobin A1c<br>may be more<br>accurate than other screening tests in the immediate postevent period. | IIa | C-EO | Recommendation wording modified<br>from 2014 Secondary Prevention<br>to match COR IIa stratifications and<br>reworded for clarity.

| Numerous studies have established an association between OSA and stroke. OSA is highly prevalent among ischemic<br>stroke patients and has been associated with considerable morbidity, including increased risk of cardiovascular<br>and cerebrovascular events, worse prognosis, and higher mortality. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)<br>remains the most effective medical therapy for OSA.366–370 A small RCT of CPAP in 127 patients started 4.6±2.8 days<br>after AIS showed mixed results with no effect on disability, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, or<br>cardiovascular event–free survival but a reduction in time to first cardiovascular event during 24-month follow-up.<br>This trial did not specify a primary end point and compared multiple different outcomes at multiple time points.371<br>The SAVE RCT (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea to Prevent Cardiovascular<br>Disease) randomized 2717 patients with established cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease (but not within the first<br>90 days after a stroke except for minor strokes) and moderate to severe OSA to CPAP versus usual care without CPAP<br>and found no reduction of vascular events, including stroke, in patients treated with CPAP over a mean follow-up of<br>3.7 years.372 Thus, the routine screening for OSA of all patients with AIS for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular<br>events or death is not recommended at this time.

| In patients with a noncardioembolic ischemic stroke, the therapeutic benefit of aspirin is similar across a wide range<br>of doses, but the hemorrhagic risk increases with higher doses. In patients taking aspirin at the time of the incident<br>stroke, the benefit of switching to an alternative antiplatelet agent or combination therapy is not well established. The<br>SPS3 RCT (Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes) found no benefit from adding clopidogrel to aspirin<br>compared with placebo in patients with a recent small vessel, lacunar stroke taking aspirin at the time of their index<br>event. However, the median time from the qualifying event to enrollment in the SPS3 trial was >40 days, so results<br>may have underestimated benefit in the early poststroke period.373 A recent meta-analysis of 5 studies, including<br>3 RCTs and 2 observational registries, of patients with noncardioembolic stroke taking aspirin at the time of the<br>index event found a decreased risk of major cardiovascular events and recurrent stroke in patients switching to an<br>alternative antiplatelet agent or combination antiplatelet therapy. This analysis included data from aspirin failure<br>subgroups in the CHANCE trial of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with minor stroke or TIA and the SOCRATES trial<br>of aspirin versus ticagrelor. However, there was significant heterogeneity among the included studies, and results may<br>have been driven by data from registries susceptible to unmeasured confounders and bias.374 | See Tables LXXXVII and LXXXVIII in<br>online Data Supplement 1. |      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| A multicenter prospective cohort of 1029 patients with AIS and newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation showed a better<br>composite outcome of stroke, TIA, systemic embolism, sICH, and major extracranial bleeding within 90 days when<br>anticoagulant was initiated 4 to 14 days from stroke onset (HR 0.53 [95% CI, 0.30–0.93] for starting anticoagulation<br>at 4–14 days compared with <4 days); high CHA2<br>DS2<br>-VASc score, high NIHSS score, large ischemic lesions, and<br>type of anticoagulation were associated with poorer outcomes.378 In a prospective, open-label study of 60 patients<br>with atrial fibrillation and either mild to moderate AIS with NIHSS score <9 (n=49) or TIA (n=11) who were treated<br>with rivaroxaban within14 days of onset, 50 were available for follow-up at 7 days after drug initiation.

| 2. For patients with a history of ischemic stroke, atrial fibrillation, and<br>coronary artery disease, the usefulness of adding antiplatelet therapy to oral<br>anticoagulants is uncertain for purposes of reducing the risk of ischemic<br>cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Unstable angina and coronary<br>artery stenting represent special circumstances in which management may<br>warrant dual antiplatelet/oral anticoagulation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | IIb | C-LD | Recommendation reworded for clarity<br>from 2014 Secondary Prevention.

| Although there has not been a randomized trial of antithrombotic therapy versus placebo in patients with acute<br>cervical artery dissection (CeAD), numerous observational studies and expert opinion suggest that it is reasonable<br>to initiate antithrombotic therapy in the acute setting to prevent early thromboembolic events. The CADISS (Cervical<br>Artery Dissection in Stroke Study) group published a randomized, open-label phase II feasibility trial of anticoagulation<br>versus antiplatelet therapy in 250 participants with extracranial carotid or vertebral artery dissection recruited from<br>46 centers in the United Kingdom and Australia.379 The primary outcome was ipsilateral stroke or all-cause mortality<br>within 3 months of randomization in an intention-to-treat analysis, and there were no significant differences between<br>groups. There was also no difference in rates of major bleeding. As a phase II trial, the study concluded that a<br>definitive phase III trial would not be feasible, primarily because of the low event rates in both groups. Additional<br>limitations included a lack of central radiological confirmation in 20% of cases and a mean time to randomization of<br>3.65 days that perhaps limits generalizability of the results to the hyperacute period. Nonetheless, the CADISS trial<br>supports numerous previous observational studies that found no significant difference in clinical outcomes with the<br>use of anticoagulation compared with antiplatelet therapy in patients with CeAD. In addition, in a follow-up CADISS<br>analysis of dissecting aneurysms (DAs), there was no association between treatment allocation (antiplatelets versus<br>anticoagulants) and whether DAs at baseline persisted at follow-up or whether new DAs developed. During 12 months<br>of follow-up, stroke occurred in 1 of 48 patients with DA and in 7 of 216 patients without DA (age- and sex-adjusted<br>OR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.10–7.31]; P=0.88). A review of published studies, mainly retrospective, showed a similarly low<br>risk of stroke and no evidence of an increased stroke rate in patients with DA.380 These data provide evidence that DAs<br>may have a benign prognosis, and therefore, medical treatment should be considered. | See Tables LI and XC in online Data<br>Supplement 1. |      |                                                           |

For patients with AIS and extracranial carotid or extracranial vertebral<br>arterial dissection who have definite recurrent cerebral ischemic events<br>despite medical therapy, the value of extracranial EVT (stenting) is not well<br>established.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | IIb                                                  | C-LD | Recommendation revised from 2014<br>Secondary Prevention. |
| There have been no controlled trials of EVT and stenting in patients with extracranial CeAD. The published literature<br>reflects small case series, individual case reports, and several systematic reviews.381 A systematic review of the<br>literature published until 2009 found 31 published reports (N=140) with a technical success rate of 99% and<br>procedural complication rate of 1.3%. However, these observational data are prone to selection and reporting biases.<br>A retrospective analysis of patients with CeAD (n=161) comparing extracranial EVT (with and without stenting) with<br>medical therapy alone found no difference in 90-day outcomes (adjusted OR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.12–3.14]; P=0.56). With<br>medical therapy alone, the overall prognosis and natural history of CeAD, including DAs, are favorable.379,380 Therefore,<br>the benefit of extracranial EVT and stenting in patients with CeAD and definite recurrent cerebral ischemic events<br>despite medical therapy is not well established.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                      |      | See Table LI in online Data Supplement<br>1.              |

| Several observational studies suggest that antithrombotics can be safely initiated or continued in patients with AIS<br>and HT. In a prospective, open-label study of 60 patients with atrial fibrillation and either mild to moderate AIS with an<br>NIHSS score <9 (n=49) or TIA (n=11) who were treated with rivaroxaban within 14 days of onset, 50 were available for<br>follow-up at 7 days after drug initiation. None developed symptomatic HT. Of the 23 with AIS who had HT at baseline,<br>5 demonstrated asymptomatic radiographic progression, and 18 showed neither clinical nor radiographic progression.<br>Of the remaining 27 who did not have HT at baseline, 3 developed asymptomatic HT.227 A retrospective stroke registry<br>analysis identified 222 patients with AIS and HT. The frequency of composite events (neurological deterioration,<br>vascular events, and death) at 1 month was significantly lower in patients treated with antithrombotics compared with<br>those who were not (1.6% versus 11.1%; P=0.041). Neither antiplatelet (n=72) nor anticoagulant (n=28) treatment<br>after HT was associated with enlargement of the original HT or development of new HT or neurological deterioration.382<br>Individual assessment of the clinical indication, benefits, and associated risks is warranted.10,382,383 | See Table LI in online Data Supplement<br>1. |      |                                                           |

When revascularization is indicated for secondary prevention in patients with<br>minor, nondisabling stroke (mRS score 0–2), it is reasonable to perform the<br>procedure between 48 hours and 7 days of the index event rather than delay<br>treatment if there are no contraindications to early revascularization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | IIa | B-NR | Recommendation revised from 2014<br>Secondary Prevention. |
| The risk of recurrent stroke resulting from symptomatic carotid stenosis is highest in the first few days after the initial<br>event.325–329 Although there is evidence that early or emergency revascularization via either CEA or carotid angioplasty<br>and stenting may be safe in selected cases,330–332 there are no high-quality prospective data supporting early versus<br>late carotid revascularization in all cases.333 In cases of minor, nondisabling stroke, a meta-analysis by De Rango et<br>al326 demonstrates favorable rates of complications when treated at least 48 hours after the initial event, and the risks<br>are not different when treated between 0 to 7 and 0 to 15 days. Revascularization between 48 hours and 7 days after<br>initial stroke is supported by these data in cases of nondisabling stroke (mRS score 0–2).334 |     |      | See Table LXXVIII in online Data<br>Supplement 1.         |

\*Clinical ASCVD includes acute coronary syndrome, those with history of MI, stable or unstable angina, or coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, TIA, or peripheral artery disease, including aortic aneurysm, all of atherosclerotic origin.

For high-intensity statin therapy, the 2018 ACC/AHA Cholesterol Guidelines recommend atorvastatin 80 mg daily or rosuvastatin 20 mg daily. Please refer to these guidelines for contraindications to high-intensity statin therapy and recommendations for moderate-intensity statin therapy.

**Very high risk includes a history of multiple major ASCVD events or 1 major ASCVD event and multiple high-risk conditions:**

#### **Major ASCVD Events:**

Recent acute coronary syndrome (within the past 12 months)

History of MI (other than recent acute coronary syndrome event listed above)

 History of ischemic stroke Symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (history of claudication with

ankle-brachial index <0.85, or previous revascularization or amputation.

#### **High-Risk Conditions:**

Age ≥65 years

Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia

History of prior coronary artery bypass surgery or percutaneous coronary

intervention outside of the major ASCVD events

Diabetes mellitus

Hypertension

 Chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate 15–59 mL·min−1·1.73 m2 )

Current smoking

| Statins have an established role in secondary stroke prevention and harbor promise in improving index stroke<br>outcomes.1,10 A retrospective cohort study that assessed 3-month treatment adherence rates after in-hospital<br>initiation of statins in patients with ischemic stroke showed a high rate of adherence to statin therapy 3<br>months after hospital discharge.387 A meta-analysis of primarily observational studies found that in-hospital<br>statin use was associated with good functional outcomes.388 Withdrawal of statins after ischemic stroke was<br>associated with poor functional outcomes. There are limited published randomized trials examining the role of<br>early statin use in AIS patients. FASTER (Fast Assessment of Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack to Prevent<br>Early Recurrence) evaluated simvastatin 40 mg versus placebo in patients with a TIA or minor stroke within<br>the previous 24 hours.389 Because of slow enrollment, this trial was terminated early. There were no significant<br>differences in recurrent stroke or safety outcomes in the simvastatin versus placebo groups. FASTER was<br>underpowered because of early termination, and the statin doses used in FASTER were of moderate intensity<br>(not the high-intensity dose recommended for secondary stroke prevention). ASSORT (Administration of Statin on<br>Acute Ischemic Stroke Patient) showed no difference in 90-day mRS score when statins were begun within 24<br>hours or on the seventh day.390 | See Tables XCI and XCII in online Data<br>Supplement 1. |     |                                                                                                                                                    |  |  |

| Starting or restarting antihypertensive medications has been shown to be associated with improved control of the<br>BP after discharge in 2 trials.247,248 Therefore, it is reasonable to start or restart antihypertensive medications in the<br>hospital when the patient remains hypertensive and is neurologically stable. Studies evaluating this question included<br>only patients with previous diagnosis of hypertension247 or enrolled mostly patients with previous hypertension.248<br>However, because hypertension is not uncommonly first diagnosed during the hospitalization for stroke, it is<br>reasonable to apply this recommendation also to patients without preexistent hypertension. | See Table LVI in online Data Supplement<br>1. |     |                            |

Smokers with AIS should receive in-hospital initiation of high-intensity<br>behavioral interventions to promote smoking cessation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | I                                                         | A                   | New recommendation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |  |
| 2. For smokers with an AIS, who receive in-hospital initiation of high-intensity<br>behavioral interventions to promote smoking cessation, nicotine replacement<br>therapy is recommended.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | I                                                         | A                   | New recommendation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |  |
| A 2012 meta-analysis by the Cochrane group indicates that high-intensity behavioral interventions that begin during<br>an index hospitalization and include at least 1 month of supportive contact after discharge increased smoking<br>cessation rates after discharge (RR, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.27–1.48]; 25 trials). The estimate of the effect for each level of<br>intervention intensity among patients with a cardiovascular diagnosis was very similar (RR, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.29–1.56]).<br>Adding nicotine replacement therapy to an intensive counselling intervention increased smoking cessation rates<br>compared with intensive counseling alone (RR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.34–1.79]; 6 trials).391 A 2016 retrospective cohort<br>study of Korean smokers with AIS assessed a timely intervention strategy versus historical controls who received<br>conventional counseling.392 Timely intervention comprised a certified nurse providing comprehensive education<br>during admission and additional counseling after discharge. Timely intervention was associated with greater odds of<br>sustained smoking cessation for 12 months.                                                         | See Table XCIII and XCIV in online Data<br>Supplement 1.  |                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |  |
| 3. Healthcare providers should strongly advise every patient with AIS who has<br>smoked in the past year to quit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | I                                                         | C-EO                | Recommendation reworded for clarity<br>from 2014 Secondary Prevention.

For smokers with an AIS, in-hospital initiation of varenicline to promote<br>smoking cessation might be considered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | B-R                                                       | New recommendation. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |  |
| A 2012 meta-analysis by the Cochrane group indicates that high-intensity behavioral interventions that begin<br>during an index hospitalization and include at least 1 month of supportive contact after discharge increased<br>smoking cessation rates after discharge (RR, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.27–1.48]; 25 trials). The estimate of the effect for<br>each level of intervention intensity among patients with a cardiovascular diagnosis was very similar (RR, 1.42<br>[95% CI, 1.29–1.56]). There was insufficient direct evidence to conclude that adding bupropion or varenicline to<br>intensive counseling increases cessation rates over what is achieved by counseling alone.391 A subsequent 2016<br>multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in which 302 smokers hospitalized with an acute<br>coronary syndrome were randomized to varenicline or placebo for 12 weeks showed that at 24 weeks abstinence<br>rates were 47.3% in the varenicline group versus 32.5% in the placebo group. Continuous abstinence rates<br>were 35.8% in the varenicline group versus 25.8% in the placebo group.393 Patients in both groups received low<br>intensity counseling. | See Tables XCIII and XCIV in online Data<br>Supplement 1. |                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |  |

This table represents the relationships of writing group members that may be perceived as actual or reasonably perceived conflicts of interest as reported on the Disclosure Questionnaire, which all members of the writing group are required to complete and submit. A relationship is considered to be "significant" if (a) the person receives \$10000 or more during any 12-month period, or 5% or more of the person's gross income; or (b) the person owns 5% or more of the voting stock or share of the entity or owns \$10000 or more of the fair market value of the entity. A relationship is considered to be "modest" if it is less than "significant" under the preceding definition. \*Modest.

†Significant.

This table represents the relationships of reviewers that may be perceived as actual or reasonably perceived conflicts of interest as reported on the Disclosure Questionnaire, which all reviewers are required to complete and submit. A relationship is considered to be "significant" if (a) the person receives \$10000 or more during any 12-month period, or 5% or more of the person's gross income; or (b) the person owns 5% or more of the voting stock or share of the entity, or owns \$10000 or more of the fair market value of the entity. A relationship is considered to be "modest" if it is less than "significant" under the preceding definition.

\*Modest.

†Significant.
