# My child has had a stroke

## What is a stroke and how does it happen?
A stroke happens when part of the brain has its blood supply disrupted. Stroke can happen in a baby, child or teenager of any age. Your child’s doctors will try and find out if an underlying condition, like a heart or blood disorder, played a part. Sometimes, it’s not possible to find out what caused it.
### The two main types of stroke
Ischaemic: due to a blocked blood vessel in the brain (often called a ‘clot’).
Haemorrhagic: due to bleeding in or around the brain (often called a ‘bleed’).                                                     
The image below shows some of the problems that stroke can cause. Some of these will be temporary, while others may last longer. Every stroke is different. Your child’s stroke and recovery are unique to them. Not every child will make a full recovery. But with the right support, they can make progress, build confidence and lead a happy life. Possible effects of stroke on a child or young person:  Emotions and behaviour, Fatigue,  Pain,  Movement,  Changes in sensation.                                                 
### Your child’s brain is amazing!
Straight after their stroke, your child’s brain may start to rewire itself so they can recover skills. This process is called neuroplasticity. It begins after a stroke and can continue for years.                                                    

## Coping with hospital life 
In the early days and weeks after your child’s stroke, you may spend a great deal of time at hospital. Your child may have moved to a different hospital which provides specialist care. Parents describe this as a surreal time where normal life is completely put on hold. As well as the initial shock of the stroke and fears about your child’s health and future, you may be worried about your other responsibilities. You may be missing other family members or concerned about how this period will affect your work or income. Here are some things you can try that might help. 
### Talk to the healthcare team 
You know your child better than anyone, so don’t be afraid to ask questions or speak up. Talk through your worries and play an active role in making decisions. Understanding what is happening may also help you feel more in control. This can be helpful in a situation where so much is out of your hands.
Tip: Note down any questions you have about your child’s treatment or medical terms you don’t understand.
### Find ways to help things feel normal
Where possible, continue familiar activities and routines with your child. This could include reading a bedtime story, playing games or watching TV together. 
### Look after yourself
Even if you don’t feel like it, try to eat healthily and get some sleep, so you can be there for your child. Ask friends to bring in whatever you need to feel comfortable or to stay with your child for a while, so you can get outside for some fresh air. 
### Talk to the discharge team 
Before you leave, find out what ongoing healthcare your child will receive and what will be available in the community. This might include medication, therapy, care and other support. If you’re worried about how you’ll cope, talk to the team. 
### Practical tips
Others you care for: Think about who will look after anyone else who relies on you (including your pets) during this time. Other commitments: Check your calendar. Are there any plans coming up you need to change? Money: Find out about benefits and employment rights at Citizens Advice. Education: Tell your child’s nursery, school or college what has happened, in case they need to plan for support or a phased return.                                              
                                    
## Going home
The healthcare team will discuss with you when your child is ready to be discharged from hospital. Going home is a huge milestone. But it’s not the end of the story. The next phase may bring a host of new challenges as you start to support your child with everyday life.
### Adjusting to life afterwards
#### Flex routines
From work patterns to dinner time, life may look very different – at least for now. Try to be kind to yourself and take each day as it comes.
#### Family dynamics
Everyone in the family will need get used to any changes. If you have other children, try to spend some one-to-one time with them every day. Even 15 minutes a day can make a difference.
#### Coordinating care
You may need to allocate lots of time to coordinating appointments, delivering therapy and managing prescriptions. Setting up a folder will help you keep on top of the admin.
#### Lower expectations
When your child becomes more active again, start small and be flexible. If you tried going somewhere new and left early because your child was tired, see the experiment as a success.
#### Symptoms to look out for
It’s natural to worry that your child may have another stroke. Strokes in children are rare, but it’s important to know the warning signs of another stroke.

## What to tell people
Most people don’t realise children and young people can have a stroke. Many effects may be invisible or hard to notice. So, it may be hard for some people to understand how things have changed for you all. Some parents have experienced people thinking they are being overly anxious or precious about their child’s needs. You can always talk through any concerns with our Childhood Stroke Support Team.
### Talking to your child
What you say will depend on how much your child can understand. Try to pick a time when you’re feeling calm. Keep your explanation simple and honest. Balance difficult news with positives. For example, remind them how much everyone loves them. Explain to older children that neuroplasticity is already building new connections in their brain.
### Talking to other family members
If you have other children, they will need help to understand changes at home, as well as changes in their brother or sister. Other people in your family may process information differently to you. They may find it easier to talk about it than you do, or may focus on solutions rather than feelings. Explore what works between you.
### Talking to wider family and friends
Some parents gather strength from regular contact with their social network. If you find this draining, update people through a WhatsApp group or do a weekly email or social media post. Alternatively, nominate someone you trust to be your main point of contact with other friends. 
Tip: It’s not usually clear exactly what a child’s recovery will look like. So, when someone asks about your child’s prognosis, this may be very painful. Explain clearly that you don’t know exactly what will happen and that you’re taking each day as it comes.

## Looking after yourself
However mild or severe the effects of your child’s stroke are, and whatever recovery looks like for them, your child’s experience can have a huge impact on you and those around you.                                                   
### Some of the challenges you may face
#### Coping with uncertainty
For many parents, living with so many unknowns is the hardest aspect of stroke.
#### Coping with multiple changes
Your lifestyle, routine, job and role as a parent may all change overnight. This is a major shift, with no warning, and it may take time to adjust.
#### Finding a balance
The intensity of care can become overwhelming. Do as much as you can, while making sure your own and others’ basic needs are met too.
#### Managing services
Navigating healthcare appointments, as well as the benefits, education and disability systems, can be stressful. You may find you have to speak up for your child and their needs.
### What can help 
• Connect with others who have been through similar experiences – through social media, groups or reading people’s stories that offer hope. 
• Think about how those around you could help – and let them know. 
• Embed regular routines that help you feel calm, such as breathing exercises, meditation, essential oils, time out for a cup of tea or spending time in nature. 
• Think about how to keep doing some things that you enjoy. These could include hobbies, creative activities, exercising, watching your favourite TV show or spending time with loved ones. 
• Focus on your child’s progress, however small. Writing down three positive things every day can change how you feel about a situation. 
• Talk things through at support groups or with a counsellor.
### Know when to ask for help
If you find you’re often feeling low, overwhelmed or anxious, talk to your GP. Even if your main focus is your child, getting the support you need for yourself is crucial.
