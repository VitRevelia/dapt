# Leisure activities after stroke

Ideas for enjoyable leisure time and suggestions for accessible activities after a stroke.  
Our leisure time is valuable and taking part in hobbies and interests is an important part of life after stroke. Doing something you love for fun, relaxation or learning can help you to feel good and enjoy life.
Getting involved in a leisure activity can also be rewarding in many ways. It can raise your confidence, improve anxiety or low mood, or help you to get fit. It can also help your recovery by giving you enjoyable time communicating, thinking and learning, or being physically active. Joining in social activities with others can also help with your wellbeing.

## Can I do my usual activities?
You might be able to go back to an old interest. But it can sometimes be difficult to return to a favourite hobby because of the effects of stroke. If that’s the case for you, it might be possible to adapt an activity so you can take part. That could mean learning to do something in a different way. An occupational therapist might be able to help you find ways to return to your hobbies.
There might be a practical solution, such as using some technology or equipment. Or you might be able to do your activity with support from another person, such as having a partner for country walking if you find it difficult on your own. Many organisations can offer adapted and inclusive activities for people with health conditions or disabilities.
You might find you can take up an activity after making more progress with your recovery. If you need help finding support with your recovery, contact our Stroke Support Helpline.
### Finding new interests
If you are not able to return to your previous hobbies, think about your interests and abilities. Are there any new activities you can try that might suit you? Get your friends and family involved. They might come up with ideas you had not thought of.
This guide gives some ideas to get you thinking, but there are also other organisations with expertise in inclusive leisure. There may also be local groups that you can join. You might need to try a few different things before you find the right fit.

## Trying physical activities
Starting a physical activity can help your fitness and wellbeing. If you’re new to physical activity and movement, start slowly and build up. Like any other leisure activity, you might need to try a few things before you find something you love.
Some areas have local exercise referral schemes for people with certain health conditions who want to start being more active. This can let you try out an exercise group or gym, often at a local leisure centre, either for free or at a reduced cost. There are inclusive versions of many types of sport. For more information, search online or ask your GP surgery if there are schemes in your area.
Physical activity is generally safe and can help you feel good. The only exceptions are if you have very high blood pressure, or a health condition that might risk you getting ill or injured if you exercise. If you’re not sure or have not exercised for some time, always check with your GP first before starting exercise.

## Looking for ways to spend your leisure time?
Here are some suggestions:
• Animals – keeping a pet, birdwatching, visiting wildlife reserves.
• Art and crafts – drawing, painting, pottery, making models or cards.
• Cinema or theatre – some have regular clubs, or accessible shows such as audio-described or subtitled films.
• Cooking – trying new recipes, baking, learning about healthy eating.
• Days out – visiting art galleries, museums or historic buildings.
• Gardening – indoor plants, flower shows, growing vegetables at an allotment.
• Music – listening to music, playing an instrument or going to concerts.
• Photography – taking photos or visiting exhibitions. There may be a local photography club in your area.
• Puzzles and games – jigsaws, crosswords, sudoku, board games or computer games.
• Reading – books, newspapers or magazines. Many are available in accessible formats such as large print, braille or audio.
• Needlecraft – patchwork, knitting, embroidery or tapestry.
• Sport and physical activity – watching or taking part. See ‘Other sources of help and information’ later in this guide for tips on finding sports organisations which support people with health conditions and disabilities.
• Walking – a great, free way to get active and see new things. Local walking clubs often organise walks to suit all abilities.
• Writing – letters, stories, or poetry, or writing to a pen friend.

## How can I find out more?
### Stroke Support Groups
Stroke Support Groups offer support to stroke survivors and their families. They are usually led by volunteers, often stroke survivors or carers themselves. They meet regularly, usually in local community venues. Some meet online via video meetings.
Groups provide you with a safe space to feel listened to and understood. You can ask questions, share recovery tips, and learn from each other to find new ways of doing things.
### Online activities
The Stroke Association offers regular, free online activities sessions, run by our friendly staff or volunteers. They’re a great way to meet new people from your own home. You can learn about the effects of stroke, share experiences or take part in exercise groups, social quizzes or other activities. Stroke survivors tell us they understand more about stroke and feel more confident after joining these sessions.
### Go online
Search for websites, blogs and social media sites where you can read about leisure activities for people with health conditions and disabilities. See the ‘Other sources of help and information’ section at the end of this guide for some ideas.

## Things you can try near you
### Visit your local library
They may have details about local clubs and events. Libraries also often stock books in large print and on CD. Many also offer computers with internet access, audio books, eBooks and online newspapers. Visit gov.uk/local-library-services to find your nearest council-run library.
### Contact your local council
Your local council has details of day centres and other clubs near you. Many councils have this information on their website.
### Try learning something new
Many areas offer adult learning, either at a college, museum or library. You can try courses in arts and crafts, technology, music, exercise and many more. You can also find courses run by a business or individual, such as dressmaking or pottery at a local craft centre. Contact the centre for details of courses. Although you will usually have to pay for these courses, some centres offer concessions if you are disabled or on certain benefits.
### Visit your local leisure centre
Some local sports centres and swimming pools offer discounted membership or specialist classes for people with disabilities. You may be able to find a tailored exercise programme for people with health conditions. Or your GP may be able to refer you to group fitness sessions with a specialist coach. Other activities like diabetes education groups take place at leisure centres.
Leisure centres sometimes offer movement and relaxation activities like yoga, Zumba or meditation. These can be a good way to get moving after a stroke, help you feel good and improve your mood.
Leisure centres should be accessible for people with disabilities. They may offer accessible gym or pool equipment and sessions for people with disabilities.
