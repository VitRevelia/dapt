# How to reduce your risk of a stroke
Active steps everyone can take

## Your risk of a stroke
Everyone has a different risk of having a stroke, which depends on the unique factors that belong to them.
Risk factors can include anything about you and your lifestyle, like your age, a health problem or whether you smoke.
If you have had a stroke or TIA, you’re at a higher risk of having another stroke, but understanding what factors may have caused your stroke will help you know how you can reduce your risk. You’ll have advice from health professionals about treating any medical conditions that could have led to your first stroke or TIA, such as high blood pressure.

## The main risk factors for stroke
### Age
As you get older, your arteries become harder, making them more likely to become blocked. You can take active steps to reduce your stroke risk at any age.
### Health problems
Some health problems raise your risk of a stroke.
These include:
• High blood pressure.
• Atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat).
• Diabetes and pre-diabetes.
• High cholesterol.
### Lifestyle
Stroke risk can be increased by things we do in everyday life, including:
• Smoking.
• Being overweight. 
• Drinking too much alcohol. 
• Being inactive. 
• Eating food high in salt, fat and sugar.                                                                           
### Family history
Strokes can run in families, so speak to your GP or nurse if you have a family history of stroke. You may need some tests and health checks and advice on reducing your risk.
### Ethnicity
Strokes happen more often in people from south Asian, African or Caribbean families. Your GP can offer health checks for conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure, which are more prevalent in people from these ethnic backgrounds.

## Actively reduce your risk
You can help to reduce your risk of a stroke by making some healthy lifestyle choices. Whether it’s your diet, activity levels, smoking or drinking, it’s never too late to make a change.
### Get individual advice
This guide can only give general information. You should always get individual advice about your own health and any treatment you may need from a medical professional such as a GP or pharmacist.
### Cut down on alcohol
Regularly drinking too much alcohol raises your risk of a stroke. Men and women are advised not to drink more than 14 units a week, and to spread units out over the week.
### Stop smoking
Smoking greatly increases your risk of a stroke. When you quit, your risk starts to drop right away. Stopping smoking could be one of the best things you ever do for your health. There is lots of help available.
### E-cigarettes (vaping)
E-cigarettes can be helpful as part of a stopsmoking plan. Unlike nicotine replacement therapy, e-cigarettes are not available on prescription. They are not harmless, and it’s possible to remain addicted to vaping after quitting smoking. Get individual advice from a stop smoking service on how to use e-cigarettes to help you quit.
### Waterpipes
Different types of waterpipe include shisha, narghile, hookah and hubble-bubble. Despite being seen as a ‘safe’ way to use tobacco, a waterpipe can actually deliver far more nicotine, smoke and toxic chemicals during a session than smoking a cigarette.
### Reduce your waist size
Being overweight makes you more likely to have a stroke. Obesity affects your body in many ways, such as raising the risk of high blood pressure, cholesterol and type 2 diabetes, which are all linked to stroke.
Measuring your waist can be a useful indicator of whether you are carrying too much fat.
BMI, or body mass index, gives an indication of whether you are a healthy weight for your height. A healthy BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9. The NHS advises people from South Asian, Chinese, other Asian, Middle Eastern, Black African or African-Caribbean family backgrounds should aim for a lower BMI of under 23.
If you are advised to lose some weight or make healthy lifestyle changes, there are some great online apps and websites such as NHS Better Health to help you. Your pharmacist may be able to help too. Family and friends could encourage you and join in with healthy eating and exercise plans.
### Eat healthily
#### 1. Reduce salt
Eating too much salt can raise your blood pressure, which is a major risk for stroke.
The most salt we should have in a day is about one level teaspoon (6g).
A lot of the salt we eat is hidden in everyday foods, including bread, cereal and processed meats like ham. Ready meals and takeaways are often high in salt too.
While cooking, try adding spices to boost flavour instead of salt. At the table, taste your food before adding salt – you might not need it!
Some people like using low-sodium salt products to help them cut down. These products are not suitable for some people at risk of stroke, including those using medication that affects potassium levels. Check with your GP or pharmacist before using low-sodium salt.       
#### 2. Reduce sugar
Having too much sugar can make you gain excess weight, which increases your risk of type 2 diabetes and stroke.
You should aim to eat no more than seven sugar cubesworth (30g) per day. Just one can of fizzy drink can have more than nine cubes of sugar.
Just like salt, a lot of sugar is hidden in common foods. And it’s not only sweet food. Savoury foods like baked beans and tomato ketchup can be very high in sugar.
Hidden sugars in one serving of some everyday foods One sugar cube = 4g sugar
#### 3. Eat less fat
Cutting down on fat can help you lose weight, which reduces your risk of a stroke.
You can help to reduce your cholesterol by eating less saturated fat and replacing it with a small amount of unsaturated fat. But if you have high cholesterol, you may need medication, so visit your GP.
Saturated fat is often a solid fat, such as butter. You’ll find it in foods like cheese, cakes, fatty red meat and sausages, as well as coconut oil and palm oil.
Unsaturated fat is often an oil, such as olive oil or groundnut oil. It’s also in oily fish like salmon and sardines, and other foods like peanut butter, avocados, nuts and seeds.
For cooking, try replacing saturated fats like butter and coconut oil with small amounts of olive oil or groundnut oil.
#### 4. Boost your fibre
Eating foods with lots of fibre can help with weight loss, diabetes and heart health, which can reduce your stroke risk. Eating plenty of fruit and vegetables is a great way to get more fibre. Eat the peel on food such as potatoes and apples. Choose wholegrain or wholemeal varieties of foods like bread, pasta and rice. Oats, nuts and seeds can also boost your daily fibre intake.                                
#### 5. Balance your diet
Across the day, try to eat something from each of the food groups below. Home-made food with fresh ingredients usually has less fat, salt or sugar than readymade food.
Fruit and vegetables: aim for five a day. Tinned and frozen fruit and veg count. Go for a colourful variety of vegetables on your plate. These can make up about a third of your food each day.
Starchy carbohydrates like potatoes, rice, bread and pasta can make up about a third of what you eat. Go for wholegrain varieties.
Protein comes from lean meat, fish and eggs. Nonanimal protein includes dried beans, lentils and nuts.
Dairy foods like milk, cheese and yoghurt provide calcium, to help keep bones strong. Try choosing lowerfat varieties.
Fat contains the most calories per gram so you need very little. Try to use unsaturated fats like olive oil instead of saturated fats like butter.
### Swallowing difficulties after a stroke
If you have trouble swallowing after a stroke, you should have support from a dietitian or speech and language therapist to help you eat safely. A dietitian can advise on making safe and tasty food.
### Be as active as you can
Being physically active can help reduce your risk of a stroke. Moving around more can also help your emotional wellbeing by releasing chemicals into your brain that make you feel better.
If you are able to be more active each day, it can make a difference to your health and wellbeing. For some people, this could mean walking around the room, and for others it may mean joining a fitness class or doing some gardening. Speak to your GP or therapist first if you’ve not exercised for some time or have any concerns.
### Illegal drug use
People may use illegal drugs without knowing about the risk of stroke. Drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine can raise the risk of a stroke. Others, including cannabis, heroin and khat, are also linked with an increased risk of stroke.

## Treat your health conditions
If you have a health condition linked to stroke, sticking to your treatment can help you reduce your risk. If you have had a stroke or TIA, one of the best ways to reduce your risk of another stroke is to follow the treatment for your health conditions advised by doctors.
### How to get your health checked
All the health conditions listed here can happen at any age. Even if you feel in good health, get a regular health check.
Contact your GP surgery to ask for a health check. A pharmacist can also give advice and do some health checks.
In England, people aged 40-74 without pre-existing health conditions can have a free NHS Health Check, which looks for early signs of health problems including stroke risk.                                         

## High blood pressure
High blood pressure plays a part in half of all strokes so it’s the biggest single risk factor for stroke.
### What is it?
Your heart pumps blood through your blood vessels. When the blood presses too hard against the walls of the blood vessels, this is known as high blood pressure. It’s also called hypertension. 
### Why is it a risk?
High blood pressure can lead to clots forming, or cause bleeding in the brain. High blood pressure can also increase the risk of heart attacks, vascular dementia and kidney disease. 
### How do I know I have it?
It usually has no symptoms, so get your blood pressure checked regularly. You can get checked at your GP surgery or pharmacy. You can also buy a blood pressure monitor to use at home. 
### What can I do about it?
If you are diagnosed with high blood pressure, making some healthy lifestyle changes can help and you may need medication. If you are advised to take medicine, it is very important to take it regularly.                                     
## Atrial fibrillation (AF)
If you have untreated atrial fibrillation (AF), your risk of a stroke is up to five times higher. A stroke can be more severe if you have AF. 
### What is it?
In AF, your heartbeat is irregular and may be abnormally fast.
### Why is it a risk?
The heart might not empty itself of blood at each beat, and a clot can form in the blood left behind. The clot can travel to the brain and cause a stroke. 
### How do I know I have it?
You might feel your heart racing or beating irregularly, but some people do not get any symptoms. A GP or nurse can check you and send you for further tests.
### What can I do about it?
If you have AF and your GP finds that your stroke risk score is high, you may be given an anticoagulant (blood-thinning medication) to reduce your risk of a stroke. It’s important to keep taking any treatments to reduce your risk.

## Diabetes
Having diabetes can almost double your risk of a stroke. 
### What is it?
Diabetes means that your body cannot take the sugar out of your blood properly.
### Why is it a risk?
Too much sugar in your blood can lead to damage to the blood vessels. This increases the risk of having a stroke. It can also lead to heart attacks, vision loss and kidney problems. 
### How do I know I have it?
Diabetes can make you need to wee more often or make you feel very tired and thirsty. Others may have no symptoms. A blood test can confirm if you have diabetes or pre-diabetes. 
### What can I do about it?
People with type 1 diabetes generally need insulin treatment. Some people with type 2 diabetes only need to make changes to their diet, while others need drugs or insulin treatment. Treating your diabetes and making healthy lifestyle choices, such as losing weight if you need to, can help you reduce your risk of a stroke.                                    
## High cholesterol
High cholesterol does not usually have any symptoms, but it’s a major risk factor for stroke.
### What is it?
Cholesterol is a vital substance in our bodies. But if there is too much cholesterol in your blood, it can cause heart disease and stroke. There are two main types. ‘Bad’ cholesterol can cause a build-up of fatty material inside your blood vessels, and ‘good’ cholesterol helps to reduce the levels of bad cholesterol.
### Why is it a risk?
Excess cholesterol in your blood can make the blood vessels clogged up with fatty material (atherosclerosis). This can lead to a clot forming which can cause a stroke. 
### How do I know I have it?
A blood test from your GP or pharmacist. 
### What can I do about it?
Your cholesterol result can be used to calculate your risk of having a stroke. If your risk is high, you can try making lifestyle changes such as losing weight, being more active and eating healthily.
Drugs called statins are often given for high cholesterol and have been shown to reduce the chances of a stroke.
Some people are born with high cholesterol. This is an inherited condition called familial hypercholesterolaemia. It is vital to get tested if others in your family had heart disease or stroke at an early age. It is usually treated with cholesterol-lowering drugs.

## Other health conditions linked to stroke
### Sickle cell disease (SCD)
Around a quarter of people with sickle cell disease (SCD) have a stroke before the age of 45. SCD is most common among Black Caribbean, Black African and Black British people, but cases also occur in people with heritage from the Middle East, parts of India, the eastern Mediterranean, and South and Central America. SCD raises the risk of a stroke because the red blood cells change shape, making them more likely to form clots.
SCD is usually diagnosed during pregnancy or soon after birth with a blood test. Treatments to reduce the risk of a stroke include medication or regular blood transfusions. 
### Women’s contraception and hormone treatment
Using the combined oral contraceptive pill or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in tablet form can slightly increase the risk of stroke in women. Your doctor should assess your stroke risk before giving you these treatments. If you have certain health conditions or have had a previous blood clot or stroke, they may not be suitable for you. Your doctor can recommend alternatives.
Overall, the risk of stroke from contraception or HRT is low. If you are worried, do not stop any treatment until you talk to your GP or nurse. Ask them about your own risk and the best treatment for you.
### Stress and depression
Some studies have linked stress or depression with an increased risk of stroke. It’s not known why this is and more research is needed, but one reason could be that it’s harder to look after your health if you are depressed or under a lot of pressure. Stress can also increase the risk of high blood pressure, which is linked to stroke.
Try talking to friends or family, and seek support with your mental health from health professionals. 
### Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)
A sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) has been linked to stroke. OSA interrupts your breathing during sleep. Some people with OSA snore, but not all. You might wake up a lot at night, make gasping or choking sounds while asleep, or feel very sleepy in the daytime. Speak to your GP if you think you have OSA.

## About stroke
A stroke is a brain attack. It happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off, killing brain cells. Damage to the brain can affect how the body works. It can also change how you think and feel.

## There are two main types of stroke
### 1. Ischaemic: 
due to a blocked blood vessel in the brain.
### 2. Haemorrhagic:
due to bleeding in or around the brain.
Ischaemic stroke is often referred to as a clot. Haemorrhagic stroke is often called a bleed.

## Spotting the signs of a stroke
It’s important to know how to spot the common signs of a stroke in yourself or someone else. Using the FAST test is the best way to do this.

## FAST Test
### Face
Can the person smile? Has their face fallen on one side?
### Arms
Can the person raise both arms and keep them there?
### Speech problems
Can the person speak clearly and understand what you say? Is their speech slurred?
### Time
If you see any of these three signs, it’s time to call help.
The FAST test helps to spot the three most common symptoms of stroke. But there are other signs that you should always take seriously. These include:
• Sudden weakness or numbness on one side of the body, including legs, hands or feet
• Difficulty finding words or speaking in clear sentences 
• Sudden blurred vision or loss of sight in one or both eyes 
• Sudden memory loss or confusion, and dizziness or a sudden fall. 
• A sudden, severe headache.
Stroke can happen to anyone, at any age. Every second counts. If you spot any of these signs of a stroke, do not wait. Call help straight away. 
### Transient ischaemic attack (TIA, or mini-stroke)
A TIA is the same as a stroke, but the symptoms last for a short amount of time. There is no way of knowing whether someone is having a TIA or a full stroke when the symptoms first start, so do not wait. Call help straight away.
### Treating a stroke emergency
When someone has a suspected stroke, they should be taken to a specialist stroke unit in a hospital by ambulance. It’s vital to get stroke treatment as soon as possible. If you suspect a stroke, call help straight away.
