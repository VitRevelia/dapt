# Holidays and stroke
Holidays are an important part of life. This guide can help you with holiday planning if you have a health condition or disability after a stroke.                                                      
## Types of holiday 
If you’re thinking about getting away, there are various holiday options to choose from, with different levels of support. 
If you have mobility problems after your stroke, you may prefer to book with a specialist travel agency that can arrange care and equipment for you. Some holiday packages also include an organised programme of activities, such as sports and outdoor activities or visits to local attractions. Others only offer accommodation so you can do your own thing. Specialist travel agencies can help you find places to stay with accessible facilities, such as adapted bathrooms, ramps and ground-floor bedrooms. 
It’s also worth considering which mode of travel best suits your needs. Specialist travel companies often offer a range of options such as accessible cruises and coach trips. Always make your travel provider aware of any individual requirements when you book.
## Air travel after a stroke
People often ask whether it’s safe to fly after a stroke. There is no set answer to this. Most airlines will not carry someone within the first few days of a stroke, but the rules vary between airlines and countries. 
You are at the highest risk of another stroke in the weeks immediately after your previous stroke. In the UK, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) advises waiting at least two weeks before flying if you have had a stroke, or at least two days after a transient ischaemic attack (TIA). The CAA advises you should seek individual advice on your condition from your treating specialist before travelling and discuss any travel plans with them. 
Each airline will have its own rules on flying with medical conditions, so you need to check with your airline well in advance of travelling.
It’s especially important to check your airline’s requirements if your stroke was recent, you have an unstable health condition, you have mobility requirements, or you need to bring medical equipment or a carer on board. If your airline has concerns about how flying might impact your condition, it may also ask you and your doctor to complete a medical information form (Medif). A doctor might charge a fee for this and you may need to complete another form for future trips. Your airline will make the final decision about whether you can fly or not.
If you’ve recently had a stroke, it’s really important to get medical advice about your own situation before you travel. Immediately after a stroke, you may need to attend check-ups and have medical treatment. The full effects of a stroke may take time to emerge. You might need treatment for these effects and you might need to attend therapy sessions. You might need blood-thinning medication to reduce the risk of blood clots. This needs to be taken regularly to be effective. So you need to plan carefully before travelling to make sure you have the right medications with you and that you take them at the right times.                                          
If you have a stroke abroad, you might need a flight to get back home. It’s important to get medical insurance before you travel. Your insurance company should give you help and advice on medical treatment and returning home.                                                   
### Travel and blood circulation
During a flight, the air pressure inside an aeroplane cabin is lower than it is on the ground. So when you fly, you have a bit less oxygen in your blood than normal. This may affect certain people with a heart problem or breathing condition, so ask your GP or specialist if this applies to you. 
On a long journey, you’re likely to be inactive for a period of time, which makes you more likely to develop a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A DVT is a blood clot in a vein, often in the leg. 
The best way to reduce the risk of a DVT on any long journey is to drink plenty of water and keep moving. Simple exercises like flexing your ankles or walking around will improve your blood flow. Do this regularly during the journey. 
If you have had a DVT in the past, and you do not take anti-coagulation medication, ask your GP for advice before a long journey. 
Some travellers wear compression stockings during a flight. Ask your GP or pharmacist for individual advice before using these. You should not wear compression stockings if you have peripheral artery disease (PAD). This condition reduces blood flow in your legs, so wearing the stockings can reduce blood flow too much. 
### Getting around the airport
All European airports must provide services to help you move through the airport and get on and off the plane if you have reduced mobility or a disability. This is often known as ‘special assistance.’ Contact your airline or travel provider in advance to discuss any additional help you will need at the airport or on the flight. You should try to do this as soon as possible, and at least 48 hours before travelling.
Most airlines will carry two items of mobility equipment for free. This is in addition to your baggage allowance. If you have a wheelchair, it will be stored in the hold. You should tell your airline before you travel if you’re taking a battery-powered wheelchair or mobility aid. 
Special assistance desks can often provide ‘hidden disabilities’ lanyards if you’d like one. This lets airport staff know you have a less visible condition but might need some support and consideration, for example, if you have sensory problems and find busy airports overwhelming. You could also consider buying a fast-track security pass or a lounge pass to get away from the crowds. 
Airline crew on board the plane are not able to provide personal care or administer medication. The airline may insist you travel with a companion or carer if you are unable to eat, understand safety briefings or reach emergency exits without help. 
Tip: If you have communication difficulties such as aphasia, carrying a communication card can help make others aware of your needs and how they can support you.
## Do I need travel insurance? 
It’s important to have travel insurance and it’s a good idea to get it as soon as you book a trip. It’s especially important if you’re going abroad, to ensure you have cover for medical emergencies and care. 
Make sure you tell the insurance company you’ve had a stroke when arranging your insurance and check you’re fully covered. Many policies will exclude conditions you had before you took out the policy (known as pre-existing medical conditions).
This varies between policies, but it could mean you would have to pay for any costs relating to these conditions. There are specialist travel insurers which provide cover for pre-existing conditions.
## Travelling with medication
If you’re carrying medication or medical equipment like syringes in your hand luggage, you should bring documentation such as a doctor’s letter. You should also carry a copy of your prescription. As well as helping you avoid problems at airport security and customs, this will be useful if you need medical help while you’re away. Make sure you bring enough medication with you to cover unexpected delays. 
Carry medication in both your hand luggage and another bag, in case any of your luggage gets lost. If you are travelling across time zones, ask your pharmacist for advice about timing your medication. 
### Oxygen 
It may be possible to take oxygen cylinders on board a plane. You need to contact the airline about this before you book. 
### Liquid medication and air travel 
Current airport rules on liquids in hand luggage state you can only take containers of up to 100ml, placed in one small, clear, resealable plastic bag. However, you can carry essential liquid medication of more than 100ml in hand luggage if you have a doctor’s letter or prescription. Airport security staff may open containers to screen liquids. For more information, contact your airline. 
### Check before you fly 
Always contact your airline or travel company for the latest guidance before you travel if you have any questions about health conditions or support for disabled travellers.
There may be restrictions on taking medications into some countries, or specific health advice on travel in a particular area.
