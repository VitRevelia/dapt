# Private treatment
This guide explains what treatments are available privately for stroke care and rehabilitation, and things to think about when you’re looking for private treatment.                                                      
In the UK, stroke diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation are available on the NHS. Some people decide to use private health providers for a number of reasons including: 
• To carry on therapy after NHS therapy has ended. 
• To have more choice about where and when you are treated. 
• To be treated by a particular specialist. 
• To have a treatment not available on the NHS. If you’re considering using a treatment that is not yet approved by the NHS, discuss your situation with your GP, therapist or stroke consultant first. They can explain the risks and benefits of the treatment, and what other support is available for you.
                                        
## What private treatments are available for stroke?
You can use private healthcare for most aspects of stroke care. If you have a stroke, you’ll be taken to an NHS hospital by ambulance for emergency treatment, but it’s possible to be transferred to a private hospital to continue treatment, if you are well enough to be moved.
Probably the most common use of private treatment after stroke is for rehabilitation therapies such as physiotherapy or speech and language therapy, and psychological services like counselling.
You can also have diagnostic and health screening checks for stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) done privately, like scans and blood tests.

## Can I have private and NHS treatment at the same time?
Having private treatment does not affect your right to treatment from the NHS. You can also stay on an NHS waiting list if you have a private consultation.
Any private treatment should happen at a different time and in a different place to the treatment you receive from the NHS. The only exception is if there are patient safety concerns, for example, if someone is too ill to be moved. You must tell your doctors and therapists about all of the treatments you’re receiving, so that they can ensure that your care is consistent.
Some NHS organisations offer private care, but this should take place somewhere separate from the NHS care. This could be in a private room or a different part of the building.

## How do I pay for private treatment?
The costs for private treatment vary depending on where you live and the type of treatment you need.
### Paying for yourself
You can pay directly for the cost of your treatment if you do not have medical insurance or do not wish to use your insurance. Some healthcare providers offer finance options to help you pay, such as loans or spread payments. You should get independent advice if you’re thinking about taking out a loan or credit agreement. The private provider should give you a clear outline of all the costs involved before you agree to treatment.
### Medical insurance
Some employers offer medical insurance as a benefit, or you can buy your own. With some insurance policies, you pay for the treatment yourself and then claim the money back. Other policies pay the hospital or therapist directly.
Check what conditions and treatments are included in your insurance. Be aware that pre-existing health conditions may not be covered if you take out a new policy.
Before you start any treatment, check with the insurance company whether it’s covered in full or in part. Get a written agreement that they will pay, and check if they need a referral from your GP. 
### Grants
Some organisations such as charities provide grants to help with some types of therapy.

## How to get private treatment
You can sometimes go directly to the private healthcare provider to ask for treatment. Some providers ask you for a referral or letter from another health professional such as your GP or a therapist. Your medical insurance company may ask for proof that the professional is qualified and registered. Some insurance companies ask you to use their preferred providers.
It can be a good idea to visit your GP first to discuss your symptoms. They can suggest types of treatment and where to get it on the NHS or privately. If your GP thinks you need to see a specialist and you would like a private referral, they can write a referral letter, explaining your condition and medical history. There is no charge for this.
### Choosing your provider
You can search for professionals and healthcare bodies like hospitals online. We have included some useful websites and phone numbers at the end of this guide.
Check what services the provider offers. Ask them if they are experienced or qualified in stroke care. Ask them to give you a cost for the treatment you need. You can compare the options and choose the best provider for you.
### Check your provider
Only use private professionals or organisations who can provide evidence of qualifications and accreditation. For individuals like therapists and doctors, you can check their details and qualifications with the professional body they belong to.
Any healthcare professional or body should be happy to share details about their qualifications and accreditation.
