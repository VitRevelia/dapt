# A carer’s guide to stroke

## Becoming a carer and looking after yourself
### What is a carer?
A carer is someone who provides regular, unpaid help and support to a partner, relative or friend who cannot manage without this support. There are many different ways of being a carer. You might not even want to call yourself a carer or care-giver, and that’s fine. You’re still someone’s partner, loved one or friend, doing what you can to help. However, it’s important to be recognised as a carer so that you can get the support you need.
If you’re regularly taking time to give help and support to someone, whether it’s a few hours a week or full-time, you need to think about your own needs too. See the section on ‘Looking after yourself’ for some tips.
### Types of care-giving after stroke
Most people need some support after a stroke. They often need more care in the early days, as the fastest period of recovery happens in the weeks and months immediately after a stroke. But recovery can continue for years and there is no set time limit. Some people may be left with effects like difficulty walking or communicating. After hospital care and therapy have ended, the person will still be recovering in many ways. By using the skills they’ve relearned during therapy in their daily life, they can continue to gain independence and increase in confidence. Even if the person returns to a familiar place like their home, adjusting to any changes can take time for both the stroke survivor and those close to them. The support or care you give a stroke survivor can take many forms. It can include practical help with shopping, cooking or taking medication. It can also mean giving emotional support, such as being there for them, listening to them or offering reassurance if they have lost confidence.
 
## Becoming someone’s main carer
If someone needs ongoing or extensive support after their stroke, you might become their main carer. This can feel like a big responsibility, as well as a sudden change in your relationship, so it’s important to find out what support is available for you.
Stroke survivors should be asked if they want family or other carers to be involved in their care, early in their hospital stay. Before they leave hospital, the stroke team will work with them, their family and professionals to create a plan for the care they need when they leave and assessing long-term needs. This process is called discharge.
### The hospital discharge process
The hospital discharge process includes the kind of personal and medical care the stroke survivor needs from unpaid carers (often family members) or professional carers. The hospital stroke team should involve stroke survivors and their carers in decisions, including decisions about when they leave hospital, what care they need, and who will provide it.
Some people can have ‘Early Supported Discharge’ (ESD). This allows them to leave hospital soon after a stroke, and continue to have the medical care and therapy at home that they would have been receiving in hospital. ESD services should provide treatment at home within 24 hours of leaving hospital. You should ask the discharge team how long support will be provided for and how it will be paid for.
If someone needs more care after a stroke, they may be transferred to another hospital or a rehabilitation unit for a number of weeks. After this, they will go back home or into residential accommodation.

### Can I choose how much care I give?
If you’re in a situation where you could become someone’s main carer, or take on more caring responsibilities, you’re entitled to find out what will be involved.
You have a right to be part of the discharge process if you’re likely to be the main carer. You can contact the stroke team and request a meeting with the multi-disciplinary team (MDT). This will bring together all those involved in planning care for the stroke survivor. You can ask questions and explain any concerns you have about being a carer. If you feel you need support with the process, you can ask to speak with a PALS (Patient Liaison and Advice) officer.
If you feel that you can’t manage some of the things you’re being asked to do, or don’t wish to do any, you can say so. You don’t have to give reasons, but it’s a good idea to talk to the professionals involved. This can help them understand your needs, as well as those of the person with a stroke.
There may be a practical solution. For example, if you have a physical condition that makes it hard for you to lift someone, an adapted bathroom can help the person with a stroke use the shower and toilet independently.
You should not be asked to provide care at the cost of your own health and wellbeing, such as back pain due to lifting, or being unable to go to your own medical appointments if you can’t leave the person alone.
### Caring from a distance
You may live far away from the person who has had a stroke and you may already have significant family and work commitments. If it’s only possible for you to provide occasional support, you should make it clear to the professionals involved that you will continue to live apart from the person you are caring for, and that while you are involved in planning their return home, you will not be able to contribute to their day-to-day care.

## What if I’m a carer and also have care needs?
It’s not unusual for people to be carers for each other, such as people who live together helping one another with taking medication or communication support. If the person who’s had a stroke was helping you manage a disability or health condition, you may find that you need some more support for yourself.
You can ask for a Carer’s Assessment to help make sure you receive the support you need with your caring role. You can also ask for a Care Needs Assessment for the stroke survivor and/or yourself, if either of you need more support to cope with day-to-day living.
### If you need to change or end your caring role
When you’re in a caring role, things often change over time. You may find your own needs change, or that you can’t keep up with what’s involved in caring. The needs of person you’re caring for may also change. They may begin to need more help or professional care, for example, in sheltered accommodation or residential care.
Social services should review your needs from time to time to see whether they have changed, but you can ask for a review of a care plan at any time. See our section on care assessments on page 7 for more information.
 
## The emotional impact of stroke on family and friends
Taking on caring responsibilities is a big decision. It’s often something people do as part of a relationship and they may see it as a natural thing to do. But caring can be challenging and it takes time and energy. Carers tell us they sometimes feel overwhelmed, exhausted or isolated.
A stroke can have a huge impact on the whole family. It’s common for someone who has had a stroke to feel quite low on returning home and to need a lot of encouragement and emotional support. They may have less control over the small, everyday things many of us do without thinking, such as getting out of bed, taking a shower or phoning a friend, and this can be difficult to cope with.
Within a family, people’s roles and relationships might change. Time spent doing caring activities may reduce your time with other family members, or you may take on household tasks the person used to do. The stroke survivor may not be able to return to their usual routines, and it can take time for everyone, including children, to adjust to any changes in everyday life.
A stroke can affect the way someone behaves or they may have communication difficulties, so the person can seem different from the way they were before. You might feel a sense of loss or frustration at the changes in the person and changes in your relationship with them. Although they are still the same person, they might have changed in some ways such as being more emotional or seeming less motivated to do things.
You may also be feeling under pressure from things like finances, work and other caring responsibilities. Or you may have care needs or a health problem of your own, and feel concerned about how you’ll cope. Often, carers are also dealing with many things at once, such as women going through the menopause while working and supporting children or older family members.
For someone whose close family member, partner or spouse is unwell, there can be feelings of loneliness and isolation. As time goes on, your emotions can change. Some things will become easier to deal with over time and it can help to talk about it and not bottle up your feelings.

## What to do about the emotional impact of caring
If you have family or friends, try letting them know you need support. It could be a cup of coffee or a video call. It can be hard to ask for help, but sometimes just knowing someone else cares is enough to make a difference. But if you find that your mood is affected, and you often feel very sad or anxious, contact your GP to ask about talking therapies or other treatments.
### Changes to intimate relationships
A stroke can also affect the intimate relationship between spouses or partners, including changes to your sex life.
Stroke can affect intimacy for people of any age, gender or sexuality, and for single people as well as couples. For example, a single person looking for a relationship might need to regain some lost confidence before going back to dating.
Partners might not be able to do things together like before. If someone behaves or reacts differently to things after a stroke, it could change how people relate to each other. It can also change things between partners if one person needs more support than they used to.
Many people have questions about sex after stroke and it’s not something to be embarrassed about. Intimacy and sex can make a big difference to your quality of life. So if you have any questions or worries, try asking for help.
The stroke nurse can answer your questions, and your GP can help with treatment for physical and emotional changes affecting your sex life.
 
## Looking after yourself
Caring for someone is a big responsibility and can feel overwhelming. It is realistic, and not selfish, to think carefully about taking care of yourself. If you don’t look after yourself, you risk becoming stressed or unwell and this could also affect the person you are caring for.
### Practical tips for self-care
Register as a carer with your GP: this can help you get some support, such as health check-ups, information about health and wellbeing, and referrals to other support services.
Keep a diary: when someone returns home after their stroke, they or you could keep a diary for a week. This can help to identify any unmet support needs.
Mind your back: if you need to help someone move around, an occupational therapist can show you safe techniques for moving someone without straining your back.
Relaxation: relaxation techniques can help with tiredness or stress. Your local carers’ centre may offer classes. The NHS website also offers free audio guides and tips at nhs.uk/mental-health/self-help to help you relax.
Stay active: try to include some movement and activity in your daily routine. There are indoor exercises like yoga and fitness routines available online. And get outside for a walk and some fresh air when possible. Being active will increase your energy levels, help you sleep better and can help improve low mood.
Check your mood: if you’re managing all your responsibilities and trying to keep going, it can be easy to miss the signs of fatigue and stress in yourself. If you notice signs like feeling very low or anxious, having trouble sleeping or being tearful, it could be a sign to get help for yourself. This could mean speaking to your GP, who can refer you to local support services or treatment.
Take a break: it may be difficult, especially if you’re a main carer, but taking breaks or getting help with some of your tasks is important. If it’s possible, try to organise your day with regular time to yourself.
If you can’t go out or have a long break, you could try to fit in 10 minutes of yoga or mindfulness. A carer’s assessment may recommend services like respite care to allow you to rest or have a break. See our ‘Respite care’ section for more information.
Eat well: try to eat regular meals and drink plenty of water. It can be difficult to fit cooking and food shopping into a hectic schedule. But having a healthy diet will help you stay well and can also help with mood and energy levels.
Stay in touch: try to keep in touch with friends and family. Friendships can suffer after a stroke, especially if you find it hard to go out to socialise. Use technology to help you keep in touch with others. Video calls can let you chat with a group of friends or family. See the ‘Using technology’ section for more details.
Don’t be afraid to ask for help if you need it: People around you may be able do some practical things, like shopping or spending time with the stroke survivor, so you can have a break.
 
## Carer’s assessment
A carer’s assessment looks at the impact that caring has on your life, and what support you might need to help you in your caring role and improve your wellbeing. You are entitled to an assessment and to receive help, even if the person you care for refuses help. You don’t have to be living with the person and you don’t have to be a full-time carer. A carer’s and a care needs assessment can be carried out together, if you both agree to this.
The assessment is carried out by your local council’s adult social services department (or health trust in Northern Ireland). It’s done by a professional such as a social worker or therapist. They will discuss your role as a carer and the effect it has on you. The assessment will establish how much caring you do (or will do) and how that affects you. This includes your wellbeing, mental and physical health. You may also discuss other aspects of your life, such as being able to work or train, maintain your social networks, look after children and do leisure activities. The local council should be able to tell you more about what they can do to help you plan for an emergency.
Before your assessment, think about the impact of caring on your life and what kind of support you might need. Try to be honest about anything you find difficult. Visit carersuk.org/help-and-advice for a checklist of things to think about before your assessment and more advice.
Your local council will tell you if you qualify for help and what help you can get. This can vary according to your needs but could include things like respite care, putting you in touch with local support groups or training in safe lifting.

## Care, funding and finances
### Care needs assessment
A care needs assessment looks at the care needs of the person who has had a stroke. It’s carried out by your local council’s adult social services department. If someone is leaving hospital, a care needs assessment might be arranged as part of the discharge plan, but you can request one at any time.
The assessment is carried out by a social care professional, often an occupational therapist or social worker. They look at the support someone may need with everyday tasks, such as dressing, using the toilet or seeing family and friends.
A care plan is agreed with the person being assessed. It could suggest things like having paid carers or meals delivered, or opportunities to socialise such as at a day centre. It might recommend the person needs some adaptations to their home, such as grab rails, or equipment like a walking frame.
### Paying for care
The council has a duty to meet the needs of someone needing care. You’ll usually be expected to pay towards the cost of care. Your council will carry out a means test (financial assessment) to decide how much someone should pay. Their income and savings must be below a certain level to get council funding.

## Types of care
### Homecare
If the person is eligible for council funding for homecare, they can use care services arranged by the council or decide to get direct payments and arrange their own homecare.
These services may help with personal care (for example, getting in and out of bed, bathing or dressing), day care, meals on wheels and respite care. They often involve professional carers coming to your home to help with specific tasks.
### Residential care
If someone is assessed as needing a temporary stay in residential care, their assets are calculated in a way that assumes they will be returning to their own home.
If they need a permanent move into a care home, the value of the home might be included in the means test. It’s ignored if a partner or dependent is living there, and other rules also apply. If the person is eligible for NHS continuing healthcare, the NHS should pay for their care.
### Respite care
Respite care (sometimes called short breaks) is designed to give carers a break. It could be: • Care at home from a trained care assistant or volunteer, for a few hours a week. • Care outside the home, for example, at a day centre or social club. • Longer breaks (from days to weeks) in a residential or nursing home.
Respite services vary widely, so ask your local council (or health and social care trust in Northern Ireland) about what is available in your area. A care needs assessment and carer’s assessment can determine if you need to pay towards respite care. Respite services may be provided by the NHS, social services, and voluntary or private organisations.
### Get individual advice
The rules about funding for care, including respite care, are complex, and it’s a good idea to get independent advice from a specialist agency. The charities Independent Age (independentage.org) and Age UK (ageuk.org.uk) provide individual advice and support.

## Managing someone else’s finances
If someone is having difficulty managing finances and legal matters, they may need some help.
### Accessible banking and public services
Banks should offer accessible services like talking cash machines, large print bank statements, communication support in the branch and accessible debit cards. They can also provide personalised stamps on request for customers who struggle to write their signature. Public sector bodies like the government and local councils should make all services accessible, such as offering text relay or sign language phone calls.
### Third party mandate
The person you’re caring for can give you written permission in a letter or ‘third party mandate’ to allow you to deal with their banking or other financial services. Banks often have their own form to use.
### Power of attorney
Someone can give you ‘power of attorney’, which means appointing you to act on their behalf. You can use power of attorney to manage bank accounts, benefits and services. 1. Ordinary power of attorney is a short-term arrangement, such as while someone is on holiday. It’s only for those who still have ‘mental capacity’ (see opposite). 2. Lasting power of attorney (LPA). There are two types of LPA. A property and financial affairs LPA allows someone to make decisions about income, bills and the sale of a person’s house.
A health and welfare LPA lets you make decisions on where the person will live and the day-to-day care or medical treatment they may receive. In Northern Ireland there is only one type of power of attorney, called an enduring power of attorney, which covers property and affairs, but not healthcare.
### Mental capacity and when to start an LPA
An LPA must be set up while the person still has ‘mental capacity’. This means they are able to understand, retain information to make a decision, and communicate the decision. If someone has communication problems, they may need support to communicate their decisions.
An LPA can be set up at any time. You don’t have to be unwell, and there is no lower age limit for starting an LPA. It is a good idea for anyone with financial or family responsibilities to set one up. It can make things easier for family and friends if you ever become ill and can’t manage your own affairs.
