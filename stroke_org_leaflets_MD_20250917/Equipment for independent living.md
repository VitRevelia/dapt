# Equipment for independent living and mobility
After a stroke, daily tasks such as getting around, cooking and bathing may be more difficult than before. Many people benefit from using equipment to help them with tasks. This could include specialist products or technology. 

## What types of equipment are available? 
There’s a huge range of equipment available to make everyday life easier. Some examples are:
### Bathroom aids
– these include: 
• Grab rails to help you get in and out of the shower or bath. 
• Non-slip mats to help stop you slipping in the shower or bath. 
• Bath and shower seats so you can sit down while bathing. 
• Raised toilet seats and commodes to make going to the loo easier. 
### Dressing aids
– these include: 
• Hooks to help you fasten buttons with one hand or pull on clothes. 
• Gadgets to pull up socks, tights and underpants.
### Furniture
– including electric beds to help you sit up and electric chairs to help you stand up. 
### Kitchen aids
– these include: 
• Easy-to-use tin openers if you have hand weakness. 
• Kettle tippers to help you pour water without lifting the kettle. 
• Non-slip mats to stop spills while preparing food or eating. 
• Cutlery with large handles for easy grip.
### Mobility aids
– including walking sticks and frames, wheelchairs, electric scooters and stair lifts to help you move around.
### Making life at home safer
– this includes: 
• Grab rails for inside and outside your home, to help you avoid falls. 
• Monitoring systems, also known as telecare systems, use sensors around your home to detect different activities. They can alert a monitoring centre or your family/carers to problems, such as unusual movement or temperature changes.
### Personal alarms
– these enable you to call for help easily if you fall or become ill when you’re alone.                            
### Telephones
– landlines are available with large buttons and displays.
### Mobile phones and tablets
– many have accessibility features like voice-activated internet searches. You can also download apps to do things like read text aloud or set reminders.
### Digital assistants or smart speakers
– voice-operated smart home devices include Amazon Echo and Google Nest. You can use your voice to ask these devices to search the internet, set alarms and play music. They can also be used alongside other smart devices to operate home appliances and do tasks like turning on lights and opening curtains.
### Smart doorbells
– these connect a video camera at your door with your mobile phone, so you can use an app to see and talk to any doorstep callers.
## Help with choosing equipment
If you need support at home after a stroke, contact your local council’s adult social services department (or health and social care trust in Northern Ireland). They can arrange a care needs assessment.
An occupational therapist or social worker usually does this assessment at your home. They will look at whether you need any equipment or adaptations in your home, as well as support with care needs. You might also be referred for a separate home assessment.
### Buying or hiring equipment
If you’re buying equipment, it’s worth contacting a few different suppliers to get the best price. If you have a disability or serious long-term health condition, you may not have to pay VAT (tax) on certain equipment. The retailer may ask you to complete a form to confirm you’re eligible.
## Personal alarms
Personal alarm systems (sometimes called community alarms) can help you stay safe at home. They usually link an alarm system to your phone and have a pendant with a button worn around your wrist or neck. In an emergency, you can press the button to call for help. Some can send automatic alerts if you fall, or can use GPS tracking technology to protect you outside your home. Your local council may be able to provide an alarm but you might have to pay for the service. You can also get one from a private provider.
