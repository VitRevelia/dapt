# Driving after stroke
After a stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA or mini-stroke), you must stop driving for a minimum period.                                                    
• Car and motorcycle drivers must not drive for a minimum of one calendar month after a stroke or TIA. 
• Lorry and bus drivers must stop driving for a minimum of one year. Some people will be able to drive after the minimum period, but some will have to stop driving for longer. Some people will have to stop driving for good.

## How can a stroke affect driving?
Driving is a complex task using many different skills, all of which may be affected by a stroke. All drivers must be able to: 
1. Control the vehicle safely. 
2. Respond to the road, traffic and other external cues. 
3. Remember and follow the rules of the road. 
The effects of a stroke may impact your ability to drive safely in various ways. This may include problems with vision, physical effects like arm and leg weakness, or difficulties with memory, concentration and understanding. 
You must stop driving for a minimum period. When and if you can start driving again depends on several things, including: 
• The type of stroke. 
• The effects of your stroke. 
• Other medical conditions you may have. 
• The type of licence you hold. 
It is your responsibility to ensure you are safe to drive. Healthcare professionals, such as a doctor or occupational therapist, can help you understand how your stroke might affect your driving.

## Do I need to tell my insurer?
You must tell your motor insurance company about your stroke or TIA, or your insurance may be invalid. Driving without valid insurance can lead to a fine or a driving ban.

## Do I need to tell the DVLA/DVA?
The DVLA (or DVA in Northern Ireland) is responsible for licensing drivers. 
### Car drivers and motorcyclists You must tell the DVLA/DVA if any of these things apply: 
• After one month, you have stroke-related problems which may affect your ability to drive safely, such as arm or leg weakness, or problems with vision, balance, memory or understanding. 
• You’ve had a seizure or brain surgery. 
• You have other medical conditions which can affect driving. 
• A medical or healthcare professional tells you they’re concerned about your ability to drive safely. 
Speak to your doctor if you’re unsure if any of these things apply to you. See gov.uk/stroke-and-driving for more information and to report a medical condition. 
### Lorry and bus drivers
All large vehicle drivers must tell the DVLA/DVA straight away about a stroke or TIA. 
### To find out more about what you need to do: 
• You should get individual advice about your stroke from your doctor or a healthcare professional. 
• You can get individual advice about driving from a Driving Mobility centre.

## Who decides if I can start driving again?
The DVLA/DVA makes the final decision about licences. If you notify the DVLA/DVA of a medical condition, they will carry out checks to decide if you can continue to hold a licence. 
Even if you did not have to report a medical condition to the DVLA/DVA, you must follow the rules about when you can and cannot drive. Your doctor or healthcare professional can give you advice about your stroke and help you understand what you need to do.

## Support with returning to driving                                                       
A medical or healthcare professional, such as an occupational therapist (OT), can help you understand how a stroke affects your driving. They can support you with the skills needed to start driving again. Your GP can refer you to an appropriate healthcare professional.
Driving Mobility assessment centres can give individual advice or an assessment of your fitness to drive. They can advise if vehicle adaptations may enable you to drive with a physical disability or help you arrange driving lessons to regain confidence.

You might worry about losing your independence, and it can be especially hard if you needed to drive for work.
