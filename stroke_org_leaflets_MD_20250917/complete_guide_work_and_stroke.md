# Work and stroke

## Section 1: While you are off work after a stroke
### Will I be able to go back to work?
With the right care, support and advice, many people do return to work. Whether you are able to return to work and how long it takes will depend on the effects of your stroke, the type of care and support you received, what work you were doing before and the amount of support your employer can give you. 
### How long will I be off work?
Every stroke is different, and every recovery is different. Some people may feel able to return to work within a few weeks, while others may return after months or years. There’s no set pattern.
Talk to your doctors, nurses and therapists about what you can expect. The most important thing is to take things as they come and follow any treatment or rehabilitation therapy you have been given. Stroke affects people in many different ways and the effects of a stroke may change over time. You should contact your GP if you experience new problems after a stroke.
### Timing
It’s helpful not to rush back to work too quickly following a stroke. For many, financial or career pressures mean they want to go back full-time as soon as possible. However, it’s important to do so only when you feel well enough, have received support and have a plan in place with your employer for your return.
You may get advice from professionals, your employer and your family who might all have differing opinions about your return to work after stroke.
Remember, you are the expert in your own needs so try to keep control over decisions about returning to work.
Many people find that work helps with their recovery. It can give a sense of purpose and focus to your day, provided you can cope with the demands of the job.
You might want to try doing some voluntary work first, to help you regain some of your confidence and independence.
### What should I tell my employer?
If possible, contact your employer yourself. Tell them that you have had a stroke, that you are taking part in rehabilitation, and that you will contact them again. Ideally, you should specify when you will next be in touch to discuss your return. If you need advice, your GP or occupational therapist may be able to help you come up with a timeframe.
Ask your employer for a copy of their policy on returning to work after sick leave. It is also useful to ask for a copy of the job description for your current role, or any alternative roles that you are considering.
Make sure you keep in touch with your employer. This should help you feel less isolated and ease your worries about returning to work. Talk through your thoughts, concerns and options with someone you trust and who will support you in making your decision to return. If you have difficulties communicating after stroke, you could ask a loved one or friend to support you and help explain your needs to your employer.
Many employers will be supportive of your return to work. Some employers may lack the knowledge or experience for supporting people back to work after a stroke. Our guide, ‘Complete guide to stroke for employers’ could be helpful for managers and HR staff to read.
Occasionally, an employer can show a lack of understanding. Section 3 of this guide has information about your rights at work and how to get help if you have difficulties.
### Tips for planning your return to work
Each time you speak to your employer, only give them the facts they need.
Helpful information to give your employer could be:
• The date of your stroke.
• Your likely date of discharge from hospital.
• A date that you’ll be back in touch with them to discuss how you are recovering.
It may be helpful to talk through what you intend to say to your employer with a friend, family member or healthcare professional first. You can also call our Helpline for support.
### Dealing with the effects of the stroke while you are preparing to return to work
The effects of a stroke can include:
• Physical problems: for example, difficulty moving around or using your arms or legs.
• Cognitive problems: these can include problems with thinking, memory and concentration.
• Aphasia: difficulty speaking or understanding language, which can also affect reading and writing. 
• Fatigue: extreme tiredness which doesn’t get better with rest. 
• Emotional changes: for example, feeling tearful, depressed or anxious.
• Behaviour changes: this can include increased irritability or becoming shy due to lack of confidence. Changes to behaviour may be particularly difficult for colleagues to adjust to. If you feel able to talk about it, you could explain that this is an effect of the stroke and that you are still the same person. We have information about managing behaviour changes on stroke.org.uk which you can share with your employer or colleagues.
Some effects of stroke aren’t obvious to others, such as fatigue or cognitive problems. We call these ‘hidden’ effects, but they can have a big impact on you. Sometimes people aren’t aware of these problems until they are back at work.
The Stroke Association offers guidance and information on the effects of stroke. For more information turn to Section 5: ‘Where to get help and information’.
### Emotional and behaviour changes
A stroke is sudden and shocking, and affects every part of your life. It’s a lot to deal with and everyone reacts differently. Sometimes, when things seem difficult, anxiety and frustration can make people feel that they’re unable to cope. Worry and loss of confidence can stop people from returning to work.
Tips for managing emotional changes at work:
• Frequent reviews will help both you and your employer. This will allow you both to identify issues early on and put in place any changes that are needed.
• Ask if your organisation can offer any counselling or emotional support.
• Ask your GP about emotional support and counselling, or find out about services you can refer yourself to. Our Stroke Helpline can tell you more.
### Try to get all the therapy and support you need
Following a stroke you may have support from the following health professionals:
• Occupational therapist.
• Speech and language therapist.
• Physiotherapist.
• Neuropsychologist.
• Vocational rehabilitation. This is often delivered by a specialist occupational therapist.
The help you get will depend on the effects of the stroke and what is available where you live. If you feel you might benefit from a type of therapy but aren’t receiving it, contact your GP and ask for a referral.
### Financial support
Whether you plan to return to work or not, you should try to find out what financial support you may be entitled to. Depending on your circumstances, you may be able to claim benefits such as Universal Credit, which includes payments for people out of work, on a low income, or with an illness or disability. Personal Independence Payment (PIP) is designed to help meet some of the extra costs of long-term ill-health or disability. It is not means-tested, so you can claim it while you are working. Other financial help may be available, including council tax discounts and grants.
Remember that there is no embarrassment about claiming benefits. The system is there to support people. Benefits can provide much-needed help and relieve the burden after stroke. Some people think that benefits are always long-term, but you can claim for a short time while you are recovering and not able to work.
Check with your employer what their policy is on pay during sickness absence. Some organisations offer full pay for a certain period, and others provide Statutory Sick Pay only. Statutory Sick Pay means the basic level of sick pay set by the UK Government. Some employers have insurance schemes to cover sickness. Others offer pay which may reduce over time, depending on your contract and how long you have been an employee.
If you are self-employed, you can’t get Statutory Sick Pay, but you may qualify for New Style Employment and Support Allowance. 
Tip: check any personal insurance policies you may have, which might pay out in the event of a serious illness or loss of earnings.
### ‘A complete guide to stroke for employers’
The Stroke Association developed this guidance for employers to help them understand stroke and support people returning to work following a stroke. It may be helpful to send this guide to your employer. This guide is aimed at employers but there may be information that’s useful for stroke  survivors and their families as well.

## Section 2: Planning your return to work
Look at going back to work as part of your recovery, rather than the end of your recovery. When you feel you may be ready to return, your employer should work with you to identify what your needs are and what adjustments they can make to help you.
### Think about a phased return
This means a gradual return to work, starting off part-time and building up to full-time hours, to ease back into work gently. Be aware that returning to work might affect certain benefits you may have been claiming. It’s important to let the authorities know of any changes to your circumstances.
#### Travel
Travelling to work can be tiring. You might need support with the journey if you have a physical disability or sight loss. You could try the journey on a non-work day to find out how you manage. You could also ask to work from home some of the time. This could be a ‘reasonable adjustment’ to help you back to work. See Section 3 ‘Your rights at work’ for more details about reasonable adjustments.
#### Driving
After a stroke, by law you are not allowed to drive for a minimum of one month. After that, depending on the type of stroke you had, your type of disability and the kind of driving licence you hold, you may be able to start driving again. Some people might not be able to drive for a longer period or can lose their licence. 
If you used to drive for a living, such as a taxi or a heavy goods vehicle, this will directly affect the work you can do and you might need support with changing career and jobseeking.
If you can no longer drive to work, you will need to find alternatives, such as working from home, or find support with travel. This might include travel funding from Access to Work or free or discounted public transport. Some employers might offer a lift-share scheme for colleagues.
### What do I need to do?
If you have an occupational therapist, they can talk about the work you were doing before your stroke and help you to set realistic goals about returning. They can advise on aids or equipment that you may need.
If you are employed, your employer may have an occupational health service to help staff back to work after illness. You may be able to get access to a specialist vocational rehabilitation professional through your employer or local authority. Speak to your occupational therapist, employer or GP to find out more.
### Support into work if you have a disability or health condition
Access to Work
Access to Work is a government scheme that provides support in the workplace for people with disabilities. This can include training, equipment and help with travel.
Jobcentre Plus individual support Jobcentre Plus can give help and advice to jobseekers with disabilities and health conditions. A work coach can give individual support. They can offer Intensive Personalised Employment Support (IPES) which is one-to-one support and training to help you into work.
### Create a return-to-work plan
Returning to work doesn’t necessarily mean returning to the same job with the same responsibilities. Even if you can no longer do exactly the same role you did before, there may still be other options to explore. It is important that you think about whether your expectations, skills and stamina match up to the work you want to do.
What is a return-to-work plan?
This is a plan of action that details someone’s support needs following a stroke. Planning for your return and looking at how you will manage the effects of the stroke mean you are more likely to stay in work once you return. 
What should it contain? 
Information about the effects of your stroke
You don’t need to go into lots of medical detail, just a summary of the effects of the stroke. Look at each effect in turn and think about practical steps you can take to address each one. 
Your tasks
The focus should be on what you can do, rather than what you can’t. Take a look at your job description with your line manager or human resources officer. Talk about the tasks you can do to start with, and what you feel you could work up to later. Try to think about practical solutions to things that might be difficult for you, such as using equipment or lifting objects. Share your ideas with your employer and try to work together to come up with solutions. The plan might consider the impact on colleagues especially if you work in an interdependent environment such as a production line.
Hours of work
You could look at the option of phasing your return. This means starting part-time and gradually increasing the number of hours and days you work.
Think about what may work best for you, such as starting later if you need longer to get up and out of the house. You may need longer breaks to help you manage any fatigue.                                          
Reviews
Regular reviews are important to help you see how you are managing your tasks. They also let your employer feed back about how they feel things are going. Think about how this will take place, and agree the time frame and expectations. It could be informal, such as 20 minutes every week with your line manager. Keep some brief notes of each meeting.
Communicating the stroke to team members
You can help decide how to share information about your stroke with other members of staff. You may choose not to tell them you have had a stroke, just that you will return part-time and that your tasks have changed. Another option is your line manager could send an email to your team, with text that has been agreed by you. 
Breaks
Many people will need to have more frequent breaks to help beat fatigue, such as five minutes after every hour worked.
Time off for appointments
If you need time off for hospital appointments or therapy, bring this up early on and get it agreed with your employer. Some employers have a disability leave policy. This can allow you some time off to go to appointments connected to a disability. It is one of the ‘reasonable adjustments’ that employers can make to support people with disabilities.
### Take a flexible approach
While you’re still recovering from a stroke, new effects can emerge over time. You might find that the support you need changes too. You might need less or more support with certain things.
If you are having regular meetings with your manager, you can talk about these changes and how they are affecting your work. You can talk about the things you find difficult, and also let them know if you are feeling ready to take on more or different tasks. This doesn’t have to be a formal meeting, it can be over a cup of coffee for half an hour on a Friday to see how the week has gone. It can be a good idea to keep brief notes and summarise any actions. Either you or your manager can make the notes, but make sure you agree them. 
### Changes at work
There may have been changes within your organisation while you were away on sick leave. If possible, find out about any changes and their likely effects on you or your position before you go back to work. Talk to your manager if you are concerned.
### Keep a diary
This can be very simple: just a log of any key dates such as when you took on different tasks and how they went. This can help you to see how you are progressing and re-build your confidence.
### Talking to colleagues about your stroke
You may be understandably nervous about how colleagues will react to you and the fact you had a stroke.
Remember it’s your choice whether you discuss your stroke with colleagues. Sometimes being open and answering questions can help people to understand and be more supportive. Don’t be embarrassed or apologise for the effects of your stroke. It can help your colleagues if you explain what a stroke is and how it has affected you, particularly if the effects are ‘hidden’.
Top tips
• It’s important to have open, regular communication with your employer.
• Talk to your employer about having a designated person or ‘buddy’ (not necessarily your line manager) who can support you on a day-to-day basis.
• Some stroke survivors struggle to talk about their difficulties or may not wish to. Remember it can be difficult for your employer to understand ‘hidden problems’ such as fatigue.
• Try to remain open and encourage your employer to do the same.
• Ask them to be as supportive and patient as they can.
### Talk to other stroke survivors
Hearing how others overcame barriers to return to work and sharing your experiences with others of a similar age can help you deal with feelings of isolation. It can also give you ideas on what to do if you experience similar problems.             

## Section 3: Your rights at work
This section explains what the law says about disability and work and what you should expect from your employer.
### Disability discrimination
Disability discrimination is against the law. It happens when an employee is treated less favourably due to their disability. This treatment might be direct and obvious, or it may be the result of a policy that appears equal but actually disadvantages some groups. For example, requiring everyone to enter a building via stairs may be indirect discrimination.
Harassment and victimisation can be viewed as types of discrimination, if they are linked to a disability.
### Am I disabled?
The legal definition of a disability in the UK is a physical and/or mental impairment that has a substantial and long-term effect on your ability to carry out daily activities. This includes the emotional and cognitive problems you might have after a stroke.
You might not think of yourself as ‘disabled’ but the law is there to help everyone, including people with hidden disabilities like cognitive and emotional problems. The Equality Act 2010 exists to protect people from all types of discrimination, including disability-based discrimination. It covers many areas of life including work, travel and access to services.
### Disability leave
Some employers have a disability leave policy which allows employees to take paid leave related to their disability, such as for treatment or rehabilitation. This is separate from sickness absence. Disability leave is treated as a reasonable adjustment under the Equality Act 2010, and employers are not obliged to offer it.
Find out how your employer treats absence due to disability. This should be in the staff handbook or you can ask your line manager or a trade union representative, if you have one.
If disability leave is not available in your workplace, time off for medical appointments may be considered a reasonable adjustment.
### Find out more about your rights
There is useful information about your rights at work on the Equality and Human Rights Commission website.                                          
### Reasonable adjustments
The Equality Act 2010 states that a disability should not stop someone from working or having the same rights and access to opportunities as other people. Employers have a duty to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ for employees who are disabled.
What is a reasonable adjustment?
A reasonable adjustment is a change to the workplace or the way a disabled person does their job in order to allow them to work. This may mean changing work times, transferring to another post or providing specialist equipment to help with certain tasks.
Reasonable adjustments do not have to be expensive or complicated. It’s about looking at the barriers a person is experiencing and thinking creatively about removing them.
Employers cannot ask the disabled person to meet the cost of any reasonable adjustments. Employers should allow time to make sure reasonable adjustments can be made before an employee returns to work.
Tip: even if your difficulties do not meet the legal definition of a disability, your employer can still make adjustments to help you.
Examples of reasonable adjustments may include:
• Getting more time to complete tasks. 
• Getting help from a support worker. 
• Changing the time you start and finish work to avoid rush hour travel. 
• Changing tasks to suit what a person can do. • Changing targets or getting support from other colleagues to meet targets. 
• Reducing working hours. You are only legally entitled to be paid for the hours you actually work, but your employer should discuss any changes in pay with you. If your terms of employment and pay have been changed, you can seek individual advice from Acas. 
• Being allowed to take time off to attend hospital appointments. 
• Regular meetings with your manager to see how the tasks set are going. 
• Working in a quieter office. 
• Having help from an occupational health team.     
Be clear about your support needs
The duty to make reasonable adjustments only applies when someone has a disability as defined in the Equality Act. It does not apply if the employer could not reasonably be expected to know that a person is disabled. It is therefore very important to be honest about the effects of your stroke and keep in contact with your employer. The way your stroke affects your work should be documented in your return-to-work plan and reviewed regularly.
Access to Work grants and support
Access to Work can help you if your health or disability affects the way you do your job, and your condition is likely to last 12 months or more. It gives you and your employer advice and support with extra costs which may arise because of your needs at work.                                      
### If things are not going well
For many stroke survivors, being back in work after a long time off sick can be difficult, no matter how well prepared they feel before they go back. They report that tasks that were easy before the stroke become more difficult afterwards, and that regaining skills, confidence and stamina can take a long time.
### Action you can take
Here are some tips if you feel you’re not doing well at work or getting the support you need.
• Speak to your line manager or occupational health advisor. See if they can suggest any further reasonable adjustments.
• Ask for a re-assessment from your NHS occupational therapist or from Access to Work. 
Stroke is complex. Over time, effects may change and some can improve. Sometimes new effects appear. Speak to your occupational therapist or vocational rehabilitation advisor in your local area and explain you need more support at work.
If you feel that you’re not getting the reasonable adjustments or other support you need at work, try to get some individual advice. Speak to a trade union representative if you have one. If not, Acas can help with work-related disputes.
### Can I be dismissed for taking long-term sick leave? 
In some cases, it will be considered legally ‘fair’ for an employer to dismiss an employee due to long-term illness. In these situations, the employer is first required to consider as many ways as possible to help their employee back to work. 
If the employer decides to pursue an illhealth dismissal, they should:
• Obtain medical evidence (with the employee’s permission).
• Arrange an occupational health assessment. 
• Prove that no reasonable adjustments can be made to enable the employee to do their job.       
### Unfair dismissal
If your employer fails to take the above steps, or if you disagree with your employer’s interpretation of the medical recommendations, you may be able to bring a claim for unfair dismissal.
If you think your employer is behaving unlawfully, you should seek professional advice. You can get advice from a solicitor, a trade union or an organisation like Acas or Citizens Advice.
If you need to make a claim to an employment tribunal, the time limit for making a claim is three months minus one day from the unlawful act. It’s important not to delay in getting advice.
The best way to avoid dismissal is to stay open and honest about your support needs, and keep in contact with your employer about your recovery.
### Income protection for self-employed people
If you are self-employed, you might have an insurance policy which offers to provide some kind of payment or income if you are seriously ill. Most policies cover some types of ill health but not others. For example, most cover stroke but many do not cover stress. Many illness insurance policies have a waiting period before you can make a claim. Contact your policy provider to find out what you are entitled to.
### Ending your employment
#### Redundancy
Employers have to consult with you before making your role redundant. The same arrangements and requirements for redundancy will apply for disabled people as for non-disabled employees.
Employers need to ensure that disabled employees can fully join in the consultation. They must ensure that the person gets the information, fully understands the proposals, and has had the same chance as any other employee to contribute to the consultation process.
This may mean asking for extra time to read and make sense of documents. If your employer has not consulted with you before making you redundant, you should seek the help of an experienced adviser from an organisation such as Citizens Advice or Acas
You cannot be selected for redundancy based on your disability. This could be grounds for unfair dismissal.
#### Retirement
If retirement is an option, you will need to think about it very carefully. Many people seek independent financial advice before deciding to retire. The UK government offers a free pensions advice service at pensionwise.gov.uk to people aged 50 or over.
There are different types of retirement, with different benefits. Early retirement may mean you get a smaller pension while medical retirement may not. Your employer and pension scheme officers will be able to help you find out if you are eligible for medical retirement.
Many people enjoy the freedom and relaxation of retirement. But others find they miss the companionship, structure and routine of working, as well as the income and status. Your decision to retire will be personal to you and your circumstances. 
If you choose retirement, think about some activities and things you’d like to achieve, so that your time is enjoyable.       

## Section 4: Changing careers and volunteering
If you decide not to continue in the job or occupation you were doing before your stroke, it may be possible to stay at the same company but retrain or change roles. You might take some time to look at your options and consider a career change.
Explore the different options that are available to you with the help of a Work Coach or IPES (Intensive Personalised Employment Support) support worker at Jobcentre Plus.
### Re-thinking your options
If you decide to start job-hunting, see it as an opportunity to choose a new career.
Don’t feel limited by your previous job roles. Consider new ideas about what you would like to do.
It can take a long time to find ideas for a new career and look for jobs, so allow yourself plenty of time. Some people use a stroke as an opportunity to re-evaluate their lives and this could involve re-training or starting a new career.                               
### Quick guide to thinking about a career change
Think about your hobbies, skills and interests. What new job can you see yourself doing? Do you enjoy working with children? Are you a keen gardener? Pick something you enjoy and that interests you.
There are many types of courses and qualifications available. These include introductory courses or formal qualifications such as an NVQ (National Vocational Qualification) or a university degree. You can sometimes do a taster course to see if you enjoy the subject and like the place you are studying in.
The types of centres that offer qualifications can vary. Many areas have a local college or further education centre. Your local authority will usually list all local colleges and places where you can study on their website. You can browse the courses available and contact the course leader directly if you have any questions.
Be realistic about how frequently you can attend classes. Think about your energy levels and travelling time if you have fatigue or mobility difficulties. You could start with a shorter course and build up to a longer one. Many education providers also offer online courses and remote learning options.
Most colleges and further education centres offer additional support to disabled students. This can mean a support worker to take notes in class, specialist software or additional time to complete assignments. When applying for a course, explain you have a disability and ask what the college can offer to support you. 
### Applying for jobs
There are more than 5 million disabled people in employment in the UK, and many employers now have a good awareness of disability. But it can be hard work looking for a new job. Most stroke survivors have said it was their own determination and motivation that landed them a job so be patient, proactive and persistent. When applying for jobs, always tailor your CV to the specific job you are going for.
Tip: look out for the Disability Confident scheme
The Disability Confident scheme means that an employer is taking positive steps to employ disabled people. Employers who join the scheme are committed to interview all applicants with a disability who meet the minimum criteria for a job vacancy. You will be considered on your own abilities. The employer also promises to support people with disabilities in the workplace.
### Disclosing a disability on a form or at interview
In your application, account for gaps in your employment by explaining when you took time off for rehabilitation and recovery. List any courses or volunteering you did after the stroke. Remember to focus on your skills, experience and suitability for the job. Be positive and proactive.
You can ask for reasonable adjustments to be made if you are offered an interview, such as ensuring an interview room is wheelchair accessible or being given extra time to complete a test. 
At interview, if you feel someone is making assumptions about your disability, ask questions about the role and explain how you will fulfil the duties. 
Some employers will have very little experience of working with people with disabilities or health problems. If you are asked about how you would approach tasks, you could mention ways that you have found to do things, such as using aids and technology to help you with planning or physical work.
Employers often say that they recruit the best person for the job, regardless of whether that person has a disability. 
Some stroke survivors worry that admitting their stroke or disability on an application form will mean employers will not interview them, let alone offer them a job. But this is not necessarily the case.
### Volunteering
If you don’t wish to go back into paid work or don’t feel ready, volunteering can be a great way to keep active and build your confidence.
How volunteering can help you: 
• Lets you explore new hobbies and interests. 
• Helps build new skills or develop skills you haven’t used in a while. 
• Allows you to meet new people. This can help with feelings of isolation many people face after a stroke.
### Quick guide to picking the right volunteering opportunity
Think about your skills and interests. What appeals to you? Are you a keen gardener? Do you like working with the public? Pick something that you enjoy doing and that interests you.
If you are unable to travel long distances due to fatigue or mobility difficulties, think about what exists in your local area. A list of volunteering organisations is included at the end of this guide. You can also look online for remote volunteering roles that you can do from home.
Think about how often you would like to volunteer. It can be a good idea to start once a week and build up to more if you feel able to. 
Think about your energy levels and any travelling time. You could start with short shifts and build up to longer periods. Ask what training is available. Many organisations have a dedicated volunteer team. As you are giving up your time, you will often be rewarded with training sessions and other volunteer resources. Most organisations will reimburse expenses such as lunch and travel.
### Things to consider
It can sometimes take a while to organise a volunteering position. For instance, if you are working with vulnerable groups like children, you may need a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check which can sometimes take a while to come through.
If there are no current vacancies, you can ask to go on a waiting list.
Be persistent! Approach a few different organisations and you’re more likely to have success.
